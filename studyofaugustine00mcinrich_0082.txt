66 A STUDY OF AUGUsrrNE's VERSIONs OF GENEsrs

II. DIFFERENT FORMS OF CONSTRUCTIONS

The material which falls under this division is of such varied charac-
ter as almost to defy classification. An effort has been made to intro-
duce as few subdivisions as seemed consistent with logical arrangement.

A. RELATED TO SYNONYMS

First will be considered those examples that are closely related to
synonyms. In fact, some of the cases cited might seem properly to belong
there. However, there have been collected here those examples in which
a single word in one version has as its counterpart in another two or
more words. In most instances this is due on the one hand to a literal
rendering of the Greek, and on the other to an attempt on the part of
the translator to use the idiomatic Latin word or phrase to express the
idea-of the original. Hence such examples might be classed as idiomatic
differenceS, as might the greater part of the material to be considered
under this general division, but since these examples are so closely related
to the topic of Synonyms, they have been classified separately.

1. NOUNs: dies—anni vitae 6: 33 11:323 extasin—mentis alienationem
2:213 venator—homo sciens venari 2 5:27.

2. ADJECTIVE5: simplex—non fictus, sine dolo 25:27.

3. VERBS: dominetur—habeat potestatem 1 : 26; habitas—incola es
17:83 placet—bonum est 3:63 possidebit—hereditate obtinebit 22 ε 173
praesint—sint in inchoationem 1:18; Gk. ἄρχειν ; praevalebis—potens
eris 32:283 principamini—habete potestatem 1:28; somniavit—visum vidit
28:123 servies—Servus eris 27:40.

4. ADVERBs: Ibi—-in loco illo 28:11; vespere—ad vesperam 19²1-

5. CONJUNCTIOst quare—quid quia 3:13 Gk. τί ὅτι.

6. PREPosrrroNs: inter—inter medium 1:14; 9:12; in medio 3:153
Gk. ἀνὰ μέσον.

Β. IDIOMATIC DIFFERENCES

As before stated the greater part of the material now under considera-
tion might broadly be classed as idiomatic differences‚ but at this point
those examples will be considered which show a different form of construc-
tion in the whole phrase. Here again, as in the previous examples‚ the
cause seems to be due to the effort on the part of one translator to render
the Greek literally‚ and an attempt on the part os another to use idiomatic
Latin. In many instances the literal rendering of the Greek results in
the proper Latin idiom.

F irst will be given those examples where the literal version has not
the merit of common Latin idiom. Factum est vespere—facta est vespera
