110 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

between the meaning against and upon. These last-mentioned uses are
probably due to the influence of the Greek ἐπί, the Latin preposition by
analogy assuming some of the meanings peculiar to the Greek. So also
verbs compounded with in are followed by super, where the classical
usage would be either in or the Dat. Cf. 2:21 notes3 7:43 22:12; 28:
13; 35:14. In 15: 12 the Latin has super where the Gk. has the Dat.
case instead of the ἐπί phrase, as in the preceding examples, although
some of the MSS of the LXX read ἐπί with the Acc. In 32:11 super
means in addition to.

Besides the uses of a super-phrase where the LXX has a case construc-
tion, that have already been mentioned, the phrase superterram is some-
times a translation of the Gk. Gen. Cf. 1:4; 3:14. In 8:21 it is a
translation of the Gk. Acc.

A peculiar use of super is found in the phrase adorare super terram,

18:23 37:10, which seems to mean to bow toward the earth. Cf. 47:
31, adoravit super caput virgae eius,

supra

Supra occurs in 1 :7 as found in De Gen. imp. lib. It means above,
Gk. ἐπάνω. In 15:113 28:13 notes3 28:14 Gk. ἐπί, it means upon.

trans
Trans occurs but once, 50:10, Gk. πέραν, meaning across.

GENITIVE

1. Gen. with Nouns: The influence of the Hebrew is shown more
here than in any other case construction. Identical Gen. and Explana-
tory Gen. are common.2 Cf. herbam pabuli, 1:12, and in firmamento
caeli, 1:14, 15, 17, 203 reptilia animarum vivarum, 1:203 omne animal
