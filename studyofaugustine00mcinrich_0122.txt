106 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

223 14:233 17:12; 24:103 27:25, 28. In 2:21, 233 24:103 28:2, the
phrase is dependent upon a noun.

De-phrase for Gen. of Material. Cf. de terra, 2:193 de limo, 2:7‚
De Gen. con. Man.

In some cases de has the force of a 01· ex. Cf. De ventre separabuntur,
2 5:233 solveris iugum de collo tuo, 27:403 liberavit de, 37:21.

ex

Ex is still found, but as before stated is overshadowed by de and a.
It occurs 22 times, 17 times where the Gk. has ε’κ, 4 times where the
Gk. has ἀπό; and once where the Gk. has the Gen. The distinction
in meaning between a and de and ex has practically disappeared, as is
evidenced in 2:16, 17: Ab omni ligno quod est in paradiso escae edes;
de ligno autem cognoscendi bonum et malum, non manducabitis de illo.
Cf. also 3: 3, N on edetis ex e0. The three prepositions in these examples
all express the same relation. Ex is relatively more frequently used
in chaps. 1—3‚ De Gen. con. Man„ than in De Gen. ad lit.

The uses of ex are in accordance with the classica] idiom except in
such phrases as 3: 3 cited above, which are similar to the uses of a and
de already discussed. This use of ex is common in De Gen. con. Man.
Cf. 2:163 3:2‚ 5, 17.

An ex-phrase instead of a Part. Gen. is found in 2:11; 3:223 28:13
42:16.

m

This preposition is the one that is most used, but it shows very little

departure from the classical usage.

A. WITH THE ACCUSATIVE

In with the Acc. occurs 110 times; in 88 of these cases the LXX has
εἰς, 111 12 ἐπί, 111 4 usque in represents the Gk. ἕως, 111 one in locum for
Gk„ ἀντί. 111 the three remaining phrases the Gk. has a case construc-
tion.

The use of in to express purpose is very common; cf. 1:143 1:15,
16, 18, 303 2:9 notes; 3:6; 17:8,193 2212, etc. In 1:14, 18 the Gk.
has the Inf. expressing purpose; elsewhere the Lat. phrase is a literal
rendering of the Gk. In 47:29 we find in me equivalent to the Dat.
of Ind. Obj.; cf. 1918, 193 24:283 5014. Other uses of the in-phrase
instead of a case construction are the following: Nidos facies in arcam,
6:243 cf. Loc. 1:153 Cum latina locutio sit non “in arcam‚’' nec “in
arca‚'' habent sed.- “Nidos facies arcam,” quod intelligitur, ut ipsa arca
