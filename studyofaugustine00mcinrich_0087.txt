A STUDY OF THE VARIANT READINGS 71

are used. Only a few exalnples will be cited. 1 ε 9 congregationem unam
—congregationem summ· 21 : 10 filio mco—filio liberam· 28: 10 terram
C hamaran—terram cultam. The readings in De Gen. con. Man, especially
in 2:19-23; 3:7 ff.; 3:22 ff„ and in Con. Adim. 4: 10—123 17:9—14‚
which‘depart so far from the text of the LXX, it seems should be assigned
rather to freedom of translation, than to any difference in the Greek text
from which they are rendered.

IV. CHANGES OF ORDER

Various forces may operate to cause the changes in order that are
noted. Where we assume a unity of versions, such changes can in part
be accounted for by the errors that creep into manuscripts through the
errors and emendations of the scribes. If the different versions do not
go back to one original translator, but to several independent transla-
tors, changes in order would naturally result, although all the trans-
lators were rendering the same text. Again a difference in the underlying
text would account for such changes even though the different trans-
lators rendered literally in word-for-word order the Greek text before
them. The examples are numerous and will not be quoted in full, nor
will any attempt be made to conjecture as to the cause operating in each
instance to produce the change in order. Cf. 1:5‚ 7, 9, 113 222, 5, 18,
19, 203 316, 10,14,16,20; 6:33 15:43 17:7; 19:193 21:103 22:183
2824, 173 32:26, 283 46:27.

V. ADDITIONS AND OMrssmNs

The same forces that produce the changes in the order of the text
would also serve to account for the addition or omission of a word or
words. The large number of additions and omissions cited under ΙΙΙ
p. 70, would tend to show that a different underlying text was a potent
factor in effecting such changes. Further causes that might account
for additions and omissions are the carelessness of the copyists, and the
fact that a verse when quoted apart from its scriptural context, or
quoted only in part, may easily suffer such changes, words unnecessary
for the purpose of the quotation being omitted, or others added where
needed to make the meaning more clear. The text of the LXX has been
taken as the basis for determining whether the example in question is an
omission or an addition. Though not entirely scientffic, this seems to be
the only practical method of classification.
