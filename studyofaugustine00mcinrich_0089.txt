A STUDY OF THE VARIANT READINGS 73

ordinate clause subordinate. In 22:14 De Trin. the conj unction quod is
added in the clause ut dicant hodie quod in monte, etc.

In 2 : 11 De Gen. ad lit. adds the phrase ex liis which is not essential
for the meaning. In 2: 15 De Gen. con. Man. adds the adverb ibi.

Proper names are occasionally omitted or added, in most of which
cases the meaning is unaffected. Cf. 9:27 Con. Faust. where Sem is
omitted: 11:10 Loc. Noe is added. Cf. also 15 : 6; 50:22. For the omis-
sion of Dominus and Dominus Deus see 2 : 22 and 3: 22 De Gen. con. Man.

Several cases where synonymous words or phrases are omitted occur.
In 1:12 De Gen. con. Man. both secundum suam similitudinem and
secundum suum genus are found, while the LXX and the other Latin
readings have but the one phrase. In 1 : 20 De Gen. adlit. the synonymous
participle volantia is omitted. In 1:28 De Gen. con. Man. adds et
generate, which is practically synonymous With crescite et multiplicamini,-
2¹9 ibid. adds plantavit, though produxit could be taken with both
objects, as is the corresponding word in the LXX. But in 3: 15 ibid.
observabis is omitted. In 3: 17 De Gen. con. Man. et gemitu tuo is added
to the phrase in tristitia. 27:40, Sermo 4 adds deposueris, Which is
synonymous with solveris. 28:11 De unit. eccles. adds lapidem in the
phrase lapidem ex lapidibus.

B. ADDITIONS AND OMISSIONS AFFECTING THE MEANING

In most cases the sense of the passage is not materially altered, but
some new element is added that is not absolutely essential to the thought
of the sentence or the verse as a whole.

In 1:11 De Gen. con. Man. and De Gen. imp. lib. both omit super
terram,· 1:14 both omit in inchoationem· 1:15 De Gen. imp. lib. omits
the sentence et factum est sic. In 1:16 De Gen. imp..lib. omits the
adjective magna, which idea De Gen. con. Man. expresses by maius et
minus. In 3: 17 De Gen. ad lit. the adJective omnibus is omitted, while
in 11:9 Quaest. omnis is omitted. Cf. 222 where Con. Adjm. adds
eisdem. In 1:24 De Gen. ad lit. and De Gen. imp. lib. add et pecora
secundum genus. In 1:29 De Gen. adlit. 6:8; 813 adds fructiferum to
qualify lignum, perhaps through the infiuence of vss. 11 and 12 where
the epithet is used with lignum. 2:5 De. Gen. ad lit. 5:4 omits agri.
2:22 De Gen. con. Man. adds ut videret quid eam vocaret, which may
have crept in from 2:19. In 2:23 De Gen. con. Man. adds liaeo erit
mihi adiutorium, and in 3:8 ad illam arborem quae erat. 3 : 10 De Gen.
adlit. 11:33 omits deambulantis. 3:12 De Gen. con. Man. adds ut
ederem, and omits a ligno, and in 3:14 omits quae sunt super terram.
