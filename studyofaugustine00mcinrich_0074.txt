CHAPTER III
A STUDY OF THE VARIANT READINGS

In order to determine whether Augustine used one or more than
one version of the text of Genesis ; and, if more than one, whether the
differences in reading and rendering are of such character as to justify
the conclusion that they have as their source independent translations,
it is essentia] that the variant readings be carefully analyzed and their
differences classified. Upon examination the variations are found to
fall under the following general divisions: the use of synonyms‚ a differ—
ent form of construction, a different underlying Greek text, a change
in order, and the addition and the omission of words. In accordance
with this outline the text of the preceding chapter will now be studied.
