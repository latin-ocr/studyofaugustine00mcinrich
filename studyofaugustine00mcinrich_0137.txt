THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 121

the colloquial extension of the Abl. of the Gerund, which in Italian drives
out the Pres. Participle in large part. Cf. Locut. 1: 50: Locutio quidem
scripturarum est usitatissima, sed graeci habent: sciens scier, quod paene
tantumdem est.

commemores ΛΝΒ ADVERBS

A careful analysis and study of the conjunctions and adverbs afford
no result, except to show that they are for the most part stereotyped
translations of their Gk. equivalents‚ and consequently are of little posi-
tive value in the study of the Latinity of the translation. The most
significant fact is that et occurs more than 900 times while the enclitic
que is found but once, 27z3 (where it is a translation of the Gk. τέ),
and atque not at all. Et is generally a translation of the Gk. καί, but
δέ is sometimes rendered by et,· cf. 15: 113 21:17, etc.

Autem is used 139 times, generally representing the Gk. δέ, but some-
times γάρ, as in 47:13. It frequently has the same force as et and is
merely a continuative particle. Cf. 18:93 21:133 where et=etiam‚ and
autem=et.

The particles ecce and et ecce, so frequently found in colloquial Latin,
and special favorites of Apuleius, are renderings of the Gk. ἰδού, and
καὶ ἰδού, and have no other force than the Gk.

Of the adversative particles sed, Gk. ἀλλά is found three times. In
27:26 sed= Gk. καί. At is found in 4622, Gk. δέ. Enim occurs 38 times,
always the Gk. γάρ, except 4³7, where the LXX has δή. Ergo, Gk.
οἴης vero, Gk. δέ; ergo vere, Gk. ἆρά γε; etenim vere Gk. καὶ γὰρ ἀληθῶς;
nunc ergo, Gk. νὺν οὖν. ὡς in comparisons is variously translated
tamquam, sicut, and once by ut, 49:9. Other particles occur but rarely,
and manifest no uncommon uses.

V. GRECISMS AND HEBRAISMS

Before concluding the treatment of syntax, it remains to call atten-
tion to some peculiar constructions that have their origin in the Greek and
the Hebrew. Many Grecisms and Hebraisms have been already noted
in connection with the discussion of the Latinity‚ but these still remain.

F irst, the following Grecism: erit cum, meaning “sometimes,’' 27:403
the use of the participle in Indirect Discourse, Ego audivi patrem tuum
dicentem, 27 : 6; the use of the participle in 11 t 8, cessaverunt aedificante&
and 18: 23 notes, cessavit loquenS. Note also the following combinations:
quid quia, Gk. τί ὅτι, 3:13 secundum quid, Gk. κατὰ τί, 1518, meaning
how; utquid, Gk. ἵνα τί, 44:7, why;1 the use of the double negative

¹ Cf. Martial 11:75, 2 for the same use.
