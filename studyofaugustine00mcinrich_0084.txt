68 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE’S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

2. ADJECTIV'ES

Difference in Degree: Positive—superlative 2:123 22:163 compara-

tive—superlative 3: 1 .
3· vERBs

a) Difference in Person: This is generally due to adaptation of the
quotation to the context. In Gen. 3: 3 is an example where such influ-
ence is not the cause of the difference. De Gen. con. Man. has the first
person and De Gen. adlit. the second.

b) Difference in Number: Bonum est—bona sunt 1:21, 25 3 morte
moriemini—morte morieris in 314 may be an echo of 2:17 where both
readings are also found, and both have manuscript authority in the Greek.
In 7:22 the difference is due to adaptation to the context. 11:7‚ ne
audiat unusquisque—ut non audiant unusquisque.

c) Difference in Tense: Present in one version—imperfect in another
1:7; 20:6; 42:23. In 129 and 3:1 the Greek has the ellipsis of the
verb and the Latin translators have supplied in the one case the present
tense, and the imperfect in the other. 7: 22 is due to the context. In
3:11, 22; 4: 15 where the verb is Subj.‚ one version has the present, the
other the imperfect tense.

Present-Future: 32:26 probably an adaptation; 32:28 where there
is an ellipsis of the verb in the LXX.

Present—Perfect: 1:28 ; 18:2; 27:32 due to the context. 19: 17
the verb is in the Subj.

Perfect-Pluperfect: 222, 8, 153 311, 23 are all translations of the
Greek aorist. Cf. also 3:11.

d) Difference in Voice: 21: 19.
