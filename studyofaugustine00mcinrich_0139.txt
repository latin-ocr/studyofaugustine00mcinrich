THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 123

Alliteration is naturally due more to the initiative of the trans-
lator, but less so than might be surmised at first thought. Almost every
instance os etymological figure has its origin in the Gk. text. Cf. fructi-
serum faciens fructum, 1:11; reptilium repentium, 1:263 28:303 seminale
seminans semen, 1:293 seminis seminalis, 1 : 29; aerarius aeramenti,
4:223 reges regnaverunt; regnaret rex,· carceris custos carcerem, etc. For
other examples, see p. 112. Other examples of alliteration that are not
found in the Gk. text are the following: filii et filii filiorum eius, filiae
et filiae filiarum, 46: 7; semen habentem secundum suum genus et secundum
similitudinem, 1:12, folia fici fecerunt, Domini Dei deambulantis, 317, 8;
damma sacta est, fornax fumabunda, 15: Ι7; mutavit mercedem meam, 31:
7; septem spicae septem anni sunt, 41:26.

That Augustino himself recognized that many of the peculiarities
of the Latin had as their source the Greek and the Hebrew is shown by
his comments in Locutiones. Especially does he remark upon the
occurrence of superfluous words and phrases, as is shown by thirty
such comments in Locut. in Gen. alone. The many cases of ellipsis
were also noted by him. Cf. Locut., 1:45, 46, 62, 125, 179, 180, 194, 205.

Three figures receive his attention, Hyperbole, 11:4; cf. Locut.
1:353 Zeugma, κατ’ ἔλλειψιν 13:1; Locut. 1:41; Hyperbaton‚ 14: 13;
Locut. 1:147. The Chiasmus in 12: 3, et benedicam benedicentes te,
et maledicentes te maledicam, is also found in the Gk. The many
cases of Metonomy and Synecdoche are characteristic of the figurative
language of the Bible, and are not peculiar to the Latin version.

CONCLUSION

Inasmuch as an effort has been made to point out at each step in the
foregoing discussion the source of the peculiarities of language and
style in our translation, it seems unnecessary to do more than to state
in conclusion the general results of the investigation. That some
colloquial peculiarities exist has been shown3 but that the underlying
Gk. original is the source of the greater proportion oi the peculiarities
is clear. We grant with Teuffel that the linguistic form of the transla-
tion, which follows the Gk. to the letter, is on· the one hand composed
of Grecisms and Hebraisms, emerging through the LXX, and on the other
hand of popular elements that combine to form an original whole. But
with Corssen we believe that the latter clement has been too strongly
emphasized‚ and that the language throughout is determined by the
Gk. original, and that the popular element from the nature of things is
