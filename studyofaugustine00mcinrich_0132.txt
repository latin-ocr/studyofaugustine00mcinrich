116 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

highest development in Late Latin.1 It seems that in this construction
we have a return to the conditions that evidently existed at the begin-
ning of the language in prehistoric times, when the Fut. Ind. and Anti-
cipatory Subj. were used interchangeaffly, and a still further develop-
ment, in which the F uture assumes the forces of the Volitive Subj. as
well. All of the examples here cited can be paralleled in classical Latin,
particularly in the poets. While many of the cases here cited can be
traced back to the LXX as the probable source, a considerable proportion
are innovations of the translator. In some of the examples the verb
may be equally well translated by the F uture Auxiliary‚ but in others
the modal feeling is unmistakable.

1. Future expressing Command: 6:14; 6:163 17:9, 11; 18:5; 24:
38; 30:163 32:4; cf.17:9 notes.

2. Future for Volitive Subj. in 3d Person: 17: 10, 12.

3. F uture expressing Prohibition: negative non, 2:17; 321, 3; 28: 1.

4. Future expressing Acquiescence or Consent: 2: 163 cf. 3 : 2.

5. Future with Potential Force: 13:16; 32:12. It is interesting
to note that the Vulg. here translates by the verb posse.

6. Future expressing Surprise: Introduced by si Gk. εἰ, 17:17.

7. In 27:29 the F uture adorabunt seems to have no other force than
the Optative Subjunctive immediately preceding.

b. INDEPENDENT uses or THE SUBJUNCTIVE

As the F uture Ind. has come to assume the forces of the Pres. Subj.,
so the Pres. Subj. in some few instances expresses mere futurity. There is
the possible alternative that the translator has erred in the use of his verb
forms and that the Subj. forms were intended for futures. Cf. p. 69.

The Volitive Subj. occurs frequently, with but few departures from
the Classical norm. In 18 :4 we find a Vol. Subj. in the first person singu-
lar. In 37:21 the negative is non. In prohibitions besides the Fut.
Ind. as noted, the Subj. with ne occurs (but non in 13 : 8; 22:12 both of
which passages are quoted in De civ. dei) and noli with the Inf. The
latter construction usually represents a Gk. Imperative with μή, while
the Subj. is a translation of the Gk. Prohibitive Subj. The Opt.
Subj. occurs in 27:283 28:14.

The regular construction after verbs of saying, knowing. etc.. is the

Substantive clause. The infinitive occurs in 1:31, De Gen. con. Man.,
