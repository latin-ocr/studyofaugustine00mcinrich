THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 93

augurari, Gk. οῖωνίζειν; 30: 273 cf. Loc. 1:110: “Ita enim dixit: auguratus
essem, tamquam diceret: O si auguratus essem, id est, ad bonum augurium
te in domo mea haberem.''

benedicere, V. ibid.; Gk. εὖλογεῖν; to bless; 1:22, 28, 2:33 5:23 1212, 3;
17: 16, etc.; cf. benedictus in 9:26; 27:29, 33, etc„ used as an Adj.

bonus, V. pulcher; Gk. καλός beautifu13 6:2.

caro, V. ibid.; Gk. σάρξ; flesh, i.e., morta13 6:3; in 7: 15, 21 caro means
a living being.

campestre, V. perizoma‚· Gk. περίζωμα; an apron3 327. Rare but found
in Cicero and Horace.

carbunculus, V. bdellium· Gk. ἄνθραξ ; a precious stone; 2:123 cf.
Publ. Syr. ap. Petron. 5 5; also occurs in Pliny and the Vulg.

cilicium, V. vitis; Gk. ἔλιξ; 49:11. The meaning here is uncertain.
Cod. Lugd. reads praesepium, and Cyprian quoting the same verse
has the same word.

circumcidere, V. ibid.; Gk. περιτέμνειν, to circumcise ; 17:10, 11, 12,
14, 24, etc. Frequent in Eccles. Latin, also in Petron. 1023 Tac.
Hist. 5 : 53 Aul. Gellius, Cels„ etc.

civitas, V. ibid.; Gk. πόλις; city, town, 4:173 10:12; 1124, etc.; occurs
some 17 times, while urbs is not found. First appearance in prose
of this use is in Cic. ad. Fam. 9 : 9, 3. Cf. Professor Abbott ad locum.

clamor, V. ibid.; Gk. κραυγή; 18:20; cf. Loc. 1:61: “Clamorem scriptura
solet ponere pro tauta impudentia et libertate iniquitatis ut uec verecundia
nec timore abscondatur.’'

cogitare, V. poenitet,· Gk. ἐνθυμεῖσθαι; evidently an error in transla-
tion; 6:6=t0 take to heart, to grieve; cogitare is a correct rendition
of the Greek verb in its first meaning to consider, but not does have
the derived meaning to take to heart, to grieve, which the Greek
verb has.

compositio, V. ornatus; Gk. κόσμος; 2:13 in one reading the Greek is
rendered by ornatus, in another by compositio, the Greek word
being taken in its two different phases of meaning.

cognosco, V. ibid.; Gk. γιγνώσκειν, like the Eng. to know, euphemistic
of sexual intercourse, 4: 17, 2 5; 19:83 24: 16. Also in Ovid, Catul-
lus, etc.

commemorari, V. recordari; Gk. μιμνήσκεσθαι; 42;9; as a deponent
found only in the Scriptures.

comparare, Gk. συγκρίνειν; to interpret (dreams); 41:13; another

instance of incorrect translation, the Greek verb having this mean-
ing but the Latin not.
