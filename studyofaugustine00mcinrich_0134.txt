118 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

the Ind. mood is regularly employed, the Subj. occurring but twice,
in 19: 16 where the Latin clause introduced by in eo quod is a translation
of ἐν with the Inf., and 34:7 where the Gk. participle is rendered by a
quod-clause, in which cases the translator, forced to use a Latin form of

construction, follows the Latin modal usage. Elsewhere he closely
adheres to the Gk.

d. TEMPORAL CLAUSES

In temporal clauses the influence of the Gk. original was but little felt,
inasmuch as the Gk. idiom in tempora] constructions was often of such
character that it could not well be literally rendered into Latin. Con-
sequently the usage found in the Latin translation reflects to a greater
degree the translator's own practice in the use of the moods in temporal
clauses.

1. Cum-Clauses: Cum is found most frequently of any temporal
conjunction, representing many different constructions of the LXX, e.g.,
in 16:53 37:21, the Gk. has a participle; in 11:2; 19:29, the Inf.;
in 44:34 the Gen. Absolute; in 11:12, 26; 1711, where the Gk. has a
paratactic construction, though the clause is logically dependent, the
Latin uses a hypotactical tempora] clause.

Cum is used with the Pres. Ind. in 33:10; Imp. Ind. 15:17; Fut.
Perf. Ind. 12:12, 27:40; 32:115 Perf. Ind. 2:4; 11:10, 12; 16:5,16;
17:243 33:183 Pres. Subj. 44:343 Imp. Subj. 6:4; 11:23 11:26; 17:1;
19:293 35:13 Pluperf. Subj. 27:383 30:423 34:73 37:21. Cf. p. 69
for variants in the use of the moods in temporal clauses in the different
versions.

2. Ut-Clauses: Gk. ἡνίκα, ὡς. The Ind. is always used; cf. 12:
14; 18:33; 19: 173 27:34. In 19:17 the combination mox ut occurs and
in 12: 14 statim ut.

3. Clauses with postquam: The clauses with postquam are generally
translations of μετά with the Inf. The Ind. mood is always used, Perf.
tense in 6: 13 11 : 133 Pluperf. 16: 3, where there is tmesis of the conjunc-
tion.

4. Clauses with antequam and priusquam: Gk. πρό with the Inf.
With these temporal particles the Subj. is regularly employed, equally
whether the clauses express anticipation, or an actual event looked back
upon,¹ except in 2: 5 De Gen. ad lit.‚ where in two correlative causes
with antequam, the Subj. is used in the first, and the Ind. in the second,
although both express the same relation in reference to the clause upon
which they depend. In De Gen. con. Man. both clauses have the Subj.
