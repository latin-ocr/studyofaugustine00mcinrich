THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 111

4:225 possessionem monumenti, 2324, etc. In 14: 23 the so-called
“family genitive’' is found with ellipsis of filins.1 Cf. Loc. 1:47: Et
multae sunt tales locutiones scripturarum, ubi filins tacetur et intelligitur.
An extension of the Descriptive Gen.‚ expressing time, is seen in such
phrases as, Sem filins centum annorum, 11:103 cf. 11:12, 26; 12:43
16:16; 1721, 24, etc. This construction probably originated in the
colloquial speech, due to Gk. influence there exerted.² It is of early
origin, as is evidenced by CIL, 1011, where in an epitaph of a liberated
Gk. slave we read, Septem me naatam annorum gremio ipse recepit.
This is very significant, showing both the Gk. and the colloquial origin
of the construction.

2. Genitive with Verbs: Dominari is regularly construed with the
Gen.; cf. 1:26, 283 3:163 4:7; 9:13 so also principari, 1:283 and
commemorari, 42 : 9. The influence of the Gk. is here operative.

3. Other uses of the Genitive: The Gen. of Comparison, another
Grecism‚ occurs in 311, De Gen. con. Man.³ Other peculiar uses that
have no parallels in Latin idiom but are literal translations of the Gk.
are the following: Praecedam thronum tui, 41:40. Cf. Loc. 1:162:
Sed “praecedam tui‚'' tui usitata est apud Graecos locutio, apud nos
autem dicitur “praecedam te‚'' etc.; and 31:71 Mutavit mercedem meam
agnorum decem. Cf. 31 :41 where the Abl. is used.

DATIVE

The prepositional phrases have encroached upon the use of the
Dat. case as Ind. obj„ and to express purpose; but the Dat. frequently
occurs in these relations.

The Dat. of Reference is sometimes used for a Poss. Gen.‚ even
when the LXX has the Gen.; cf. 1:29, 303 3:5‚ 15, etc.‚ and especially
47:20. Loc. 1:199: et facta est terra Pharaoni, non ait Pharaonis.
Amat sic loqui scriptura. The Dat. is used after servus and famulus
instead of the Gen. in 9:25, and 9:25 notes3 but in 27:37, 40 the Gen.
occurs.

The Dat. is used with some compound verbs with which it does not
occur in Classical Latin. Cf. constituere, 18:193 adorare, 24:263 cf.
Loc. 1:82: Adoravit Domino: quod nobis usitatum est dicere adoravit
Dominum;4 but the Acc. is found with the same verb, 2 3:7; obaudire,
