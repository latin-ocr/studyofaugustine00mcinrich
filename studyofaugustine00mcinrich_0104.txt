88 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

VERBS IN -FICARE1

latificare, to enlarge, 9:27. Forcellini cites only Gloss. Philox. for this
word. Cf. Ronsch, p. 177, who also cites Ambr. Ep. 46.

magnificare, to glorify, 12:2. Occurs in Plaut. Stich. 122, 443 Men.
2: 3, 193 also in Terent. and Pliny the Elder. Ronsch‚ p. 177.

sanctificare, to hallow, 2: 3. F requent in Vulg. Ronsch, p. 178.

C. HYBRID DERIVATIVES²

Very few such forms are found in our text. Cf. praeputium (prae-l-
πόσθιον) 17:14, 24; cf. Seneca Apoc. 8: 3 ; Juvenal 14:99; common in
the Vulg. Perhaps the two adjectives bicameratus and tricameratus
(6:16) may be classed here; the form cameratus being derived from
camera, camara, Gk. καμάρα. These words also occur in Ambr.
De Noe et Arca 9. Ro'nsch, pp. 142, 145.

II. INPLECTION

As one would naturally expect the peculiarities in forms are very few
in number, and the departure from classical usage much less frequent
than in Syntax.

A. DECLENSION

In pure Latin words the only peculiarity is the declension of agna,
the Abl. form agnabus occurring in 31:41. The same form occurs in
Hier. Retr. 2:55, 1. In 31 : 7 the Gen. form agnorum is found.

In the declension of Greek words there is a preference for the Latin
forms. Note especially cetos 1:21, instead of cete. A few Acc. in -n
occur, as extasin 2:213 Euphraten 15:18.

In the case of Hebrew words there is some variation in usage. A
majority are not declined, but those whose terminations are similar to
the termination of the Latin Nom. are in many cases declined, but there
seems to be no uniformity of usage. The following forms may be
noted:

Adam, Nom. 2:193 Adae, Dat. 2:16, 203 Adam, Dat. 3:21, Acc. 2:19.

Abram, Nom. 11:29; Abraham, 17:53 Abrahae, Gen. 20:183 2419, et al.;
Dat. 12:73 16:16, et al.

Ballam, Ace. 29:293 Ballan, Acc. 30:4.

Charram, Acc. 28:103 Charran, Ace. 11:31; 28:103 Charra, Abl. 11:32.

Cherubim, Ace. 3:24, De Gen. con. Man.; Cherubin, 3:24, De Gen.
ad lit.
