10 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

to determine whether Augustine consistently used one type of text,
or whether more than one type can be discerned3 to compare the recon-
structed text first, with the other extant fragments os Genesis, both the
church Fathers and the fragments of MSS, in order to determine whether
there was one or more than one original translation of that book; sec-
ondly, with the Vulgate, so as to ascertain what influence, if any, the
pre-Hieronymian translation had upon the version of Jerome3 thirdly‚
with the LXX, in order to learn whether the translation of Genesis as
quoted by Augustine possesses the “tenacitas verborum cum per-
spicuitate sententiae'' of the Itala. F inally, it was planned to make a
thorough study of the Latinity, so as to determine whether the language
of the translation is the colloquial speech and whether elements are
found therein that justify a conclusion as to the place of. its origin. It
soon became apparent that the investigation as originally outlined
would exceed the limits set upon this monograph, and it was finally
decided to confine the present investigation to a reconstruction of the
text, to a comparative study of the text with reference to its bearing
upon the question of the unity both of St. Augustine's Bible and of the
Old Latin Bible as a whole, and particularly to a study of the Latinity
of the translation. It is hoped that the work as originally planned may
be completed at a later date.
