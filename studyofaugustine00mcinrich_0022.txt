6 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE’S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

sen formerly inclined to Bentley's interpretation and attempted to show
that such a reading is in harmony with the context.1 Another emenda-
tion is suggested by Potter, who proposes to read “itata’' for “Itala,’'
and believes that “us’' has dropped out after “interpretationibus''
and would thus restore “usitata.’' But such an emendation would not
solve the problem, for we should still have to explain what the “inter-
pretatio usitata’' was.

Accepting the reading as it stands, what explanations are offered? A
complete account would exceed the limits of this paper and we must
confine ourselves to a brief statement of some of the views held.2 Saba·
tier maintains that the “Itala '² was the Old Latin Bible as cited at least
in the greater part of the works of Augustine.³ Wiseman, followed by
Tischendorf, Lachmann, and others, maintains that “Itala'' need not
be considered as the name of some specific version, in contradistinc-
tion to other translations, nor can it be considered as the name of the
one received version, but concludes that in the passage about the “ Itala ’'
Augustine meant nothing more than to specify the preference he gave
to the text in Italian codices, and that the term “ Itala '² is not an appella-
tive, but a relative term adopted by him because he lived in Africa.⁴
Ott holds that “Itala'' is only the popular name of the Old Latin Bible
in contrast to the Greek original, and that in the speech of the educated
it would be called “Latina translatio'' or “interpretatio.''⁵ Ziegler in
opposition to this view argues that the home of the “Itala,” an inde-
pendent translation, was, as the name signifies, Italy.⁶ Kenrich holds
that northern Italy during the fourth century was known as “Italia,’'⁷
and Kennedy thinks that as this was the region in which Augustine
first became acquainted with the Scriptures it is probable that the
revision of the Bible was made in northern Italy, and so naturally
became known to Augustine.8

Burkitt,⁹ following Reuss and Breyther,¹⁰ has lately essayed to prove
that the “Itala'' is the Vulgate of Jerome, his main arguments being the
