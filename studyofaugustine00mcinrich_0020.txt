4 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

meaning the slightest resemblance to a historical tradition or an ancient
report. It is rather the scant result of a more or less intelligent view of
the actual facts which they had before their eyes.'⁷1

A study and a comparison of the different readings found in the
manuscripts and the citations of the F athers is then the point upon which
a conclusion as to the unity or multiplicity of the original translations
must be based. As before stated, all agree as to the existence of a large
number of more or less important variations in readings. But since the
opinions of scholars differ so widely as to what constitutes the char-
acteristics which justify the conclusion that different readings have as
their source different original versions, and since the supporters of a
one-version theory proceed upon a basis of classification so elastic as to
admit of almost any change in reading without resort to the assumption
of a different original as the cause, it seems impossible to reach any
common opinion. The decision of the individual scholar will depend
upon his conception of what constitutes an independent version or trans-
lation.

Inseparably connected with the question as to the number of versions
of the Old Latin Bible is the place of its translation. Here again there
is great diversity of opinion, Italy, Africa, and Syria each having its

supporters. Kaulen, Reinken, Gams,² and others have decided for ,

Rome on the supposition that at Rome the members representing the
lower stratum of society would require a Latin text. But since the days
of Wiseman the majority of scholars have favored Africa as the home
of the translation.³ Wiseman bases his conclusions upon two lines of
argument. The first, developed at some length, is that historical evi-
dence leads to the belief that Greek was the text in use at Rome before
the fourth century, while in the African writers we have positive proof
of the earlier existence of a Latin translation in that country. The
second method of determining the home of the translation, and the one
which he considers the most satisfactory, is a study of the language
and style, which he and his followers maintain find their closest parallel
in African writers.4

A later view is one adopted by Hort, Sanday, and others, who pro-
ceed in an entirely different direction in their effort to determine the
