THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 119

Clauses with antequam occur in 2;5; 11 :4; 2727, 25, 33; 36:31, the last
two of which are determinative clauses of actual events looked back
upon. Priusquam occurs in 48:5.

5. Clauses with donec meaning until: Gk. ἕως with Ins„ except in
49:10, where the LXX has ἕως ἅν with the Subj. The use of the moods
with donec is the same as in classical Latin. The Pres. Subj. occurs in
3:19; 19:22; 28: 15; 49:10, in anticipatory clauses; and the Pers. Ind.
in 8:7‚ in a determinative clause of fact.

6. Clauses with dum meaning while: Gk. ἐν with the Inf.; dum
occurs in 4:83 32: 25 introducing clauses of situation,1 but instead of the
Pres. Ind. the Imp. Subj. is used. ’

7. Clauses with quoadusque meaning until: Gk. ἕως with Ind.,
Subj„ and 1nf.; in 24: 14 it is used with the Fut. Ind.; in 26: 13; 41 :49
with the Pers. Ind.; in 42:16 with the Pres. Subj. According to Sittl
this use of quoadusque was confined to theological works until the Middle
Ages.²

Ι. Clauses of Purpose with ut and ne: The Subj. with ut and ne
is the most common construction. Many Ins. of Purpose in the LXX are
translated by ut-clauses. The only irregularity in the syntax of purpose
clauses is the occasional use of ut non in a negative clause, instead of ne.
Cf. 11: 7; 42:23 43:83 44:34. Sometimes where one version has ut
non, another has the regular ne. The different versions also differ in the
construction used to express the purpose idea. See p. 69.

2. Relative Clauses of Purpose: With qui 2 ε 5; with ubi 23 :4.

3. Other Expressions of Purpose: The Inf. of Purpose is a very com-
mon construction. It usually occurs with verbs of motion, but its use
is not confined to such verbs. Cf. 24: 32. Here the infinitive does not
occur in the LXX, but is found in many MSS. This construction occurs
18 times, and is due to the infiuence of the LXX. The use of the Gerund
or Gerundive with ad to express purpose is very rare, occurring only in
316, 24, De Gen. con. Man.

f. SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES

The following points of interest are to be noted in connection with
substantive clauses. First‚ the use of ut non instead of ne in clauses
containing a negative idea; cf. 16: 2 ; 20:6; 24: 3; second, the use of ut
after a verb of prevention; cs. 2 3:6; third, a substantive clause intro-
