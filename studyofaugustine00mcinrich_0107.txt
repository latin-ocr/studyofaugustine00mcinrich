THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 91

3:18, τρίβολος; thesaurus, 43:23, θησαυρός; calix, 40:13, κύλιξ; and
canistra, 40:16, κανάστρα are used where the LXX has different words.
Both of these words are in good Latin usage at an early date.

ADJECTIVE

prasinus, V. onychinus Gk. πράσινος; a gem; 2: 12. Occurs in Petron. 27;
Pliny 37: 103 Mart. 10:29, ete.

VERB

But one Greek verb, zelare, Gk. ζηλοῦν; 30:1, is found. This verb
is also found in Tertul., Aug., and frequently in the Vulg.

The number of Greek words is thus seen to be very small, 29 in all,
if such words as leo and camelus are included,1 and most of those found
were Latinized at an early date, abyssus, extasis, augelus, holocaustum,
paranymphus, and zelare being the only words of comparatively late
origin. Thielmann maintains that it was a characteristic of African
Latin to use a large number of Greek words, and explains the relatively
small number occurring in the Latin translation of the book Sapientia
as compared with Sirach as due to the purism of the older school of trans-
lators, which considered itself bound to practice its art even on Greek
words that had passed over into good Latin usage. If this conclusion
be well founded, it would tend to show that our translation of Genesis is
either not African, or, if it be African, is of early origin. But as stated
before² the translation is for the most part very close to the Greek origi-
nal, while Thielmann assertS, “Je freier eine lateinische IIbersetzung
ihrem Original verfahrt‚ desto alter ist sie.³'’ Hence according to this
criterion our translation would be late. Thus according to the criteria
that Thielmann employs, we are led to the two diametrically opposed
conclusions, first, that our translation is early, and second, that it is late.

B. WORDS OF HEBREW ORIGIN

The only word of Hebrew origin, other than proper nouns, is sabech,
V. vepris,· Gk. σαβέκ; a thicket; 22:13.

C. RARE WORDS AND DEPARTURES FROM C·LASS1CAL USAGE⁴

accipere, V. ducere,· Gk. λαμβάνειν ; =sum6r6,· 25:30, accepit Rebeccam
sibi in uxorem‚· V. ignoscere; Gk. δέχεσθαι; 50:17, cf. Loc. 1:212.
