112 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE’S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

which is regularly construed with the Dat. (cf. 22:18) takes the Acc.
in 26: .

In 524: 32 the Dat. pedibus is easily explained, if the passage be corn-
pared with the LXX, which reads: ‘⁶ He gave them water for their feet,''

etc.
ACCUSATIVE

The following examples of the Etymological Acc. or Cognate Acc.,
a construction common to all periods of the language‚ occur: nominare
nomen, 4:25, 26; cognominare nomen, 5:2; 22:14; odorari odorem,
27:273 venari venationem, 2723, 333 plangere planctum, 50:10. All
but 4:26 and 22:14 have their origin in the Greek. In 17:11; 14:24,
the Acc. occurs with the Passive voice of the verb circumcidere; e.g.,
circumcidi carnem, a construction that goes back to the Hebrew.
Cf. Loc. 1 : 58: Non dixit: carne aut in carne.

Note also the double Acc. with dare: 16:3; 30:4; the Ace. regularly
with benedicere,· and the Ace. without per in an oath; cf. 24:33 Loc.
117 5: Graeci non habent “per’' sed adiurabo te Dominum Deum caeli.
All of the above are literal renderings of the Greek.

ABLATIVE

There are few new or striking constructions of the Abl. Duration
of time is frequently expressed by the Abl., but more often by the Ace.
The Abl. construction occurs in 3:14 De Gen. con. Man.; 15:13; 29:
20; 50:103 the Acc. in 3:14 De Gen. adlit. 5:63 724, 243 29:27, 303
50:22.

A use of the Abl. that has its origin in a Hebrew idjom is the follow-
ing: morte moriemini, 2:17; 3t4, meaning literally “thou shalt die
with a death‚'' i.e., an emphatic method of expression meaning “thou
shalt surely die.'' Cf. circumcisione circumcidetur, 17: 133 and reddi-
tione reddet, 50: 153 and see under esca, p. 95.

The Abl. Absolute is studiously avoided, occurring but twice: 25:
63 38:143 in the former the LXX has the Gen. Abs.

C. SYNTAX OF THE ADJECTIVE

The substantive use of the Adjective, common to all periods of the
language, is extensively employed. Some of the more striking examples
will be cited. Such of these as are starred have been discussed at greater
length under Vocabulary, pp. 92 ff: *arida, 1:9, 103 7:223 *reptile,
1:20, 24, etc.; volatile, 1:20, 21, 26, etc.; viride, 2:53 *campestre, 3:73
maligna, 6:53 8:213 repens, 6:73 media, 15:173 masculinum, 17:103
