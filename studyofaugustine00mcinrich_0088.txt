72 Α STUDY OF AUGUSTINE’S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

A. ADDITIONS AND OMISSIONS THAT DO NOT AFFECT THE MEANING OF
THE PASSAGE

Here will be classed those passages where the omission does not
detract from the meaning of the text, nor the addition contribute any
new element to the thought. The use of the pronouns affords many
examples. nor are they confined to any one version. In 3:17 De Gen. con.
Man. adds tibi in pursuance of the free form of construction prevailing
there. In 27:29 Sermo 4 omits the te with benedixerit. 1:11 both De
Gen. con. Man. and De Gen. imp. lib. add the possessive suum in the
phrase secundum genus suum. 1:21 De Gen. imp. lib. again supplies
suum in the same phrase. 2 : 24 De Gen. con. Man. omits both pronouns
in the phrase patrem suum et matrem suam. In 1:26 as found in Loc.
nostram is omitted. In 3: 14 the possessive tuo is not expressed in the
phrase pectore tuo in De Gen. con. Man„ but in De Gen. ad lit. we find
super pectus tuum.

Demonstratives used as personal pronouns: In 3:12, 20 De Gen.
con. Man. omits haec. In 3:10 De Gen. con. Man. omits the dative
ei, and adds the nominative ille. In the same work and also in De Gen.
adlit. 11 z 1 the intensive is added in 2:20. In 18: 11 the reading of Loc.
omits ipsis. In 26:4 Con. Cresc. omits the demonstrative hanc in the
phrase terram hanc.

Where the Greek repeats the preposition with the second of two
objects, the Latin sometimes fails to do so. Cf. the omission of inter
117 De Gen. imp. lib„ and 3:15 De Gen. con. Man.; and of secundum
1:11 De Gen. con. Man. and De Gen. imp. lib.

In 1:12; 3:17 De Gen. con. Man„ and 27:29 Sermo 4, where there
is ellipsis of the verb in the LXX, the Latin supplies the appropriate
forms of the verb esse. Similarly in 2:14 De Gen. con. Man. dicitur is
supplied. Oi slightly different character is Gen. 22:17, where the
attributive prepositional phrase of the Greek is rendered by a relative
clause quae est, etc.; but in De civ. est is omitted.

Many cases of Asyndeton occur. Et is omitted >in 2:12; 3:17 De
Gen. con. Man.; 19:ss Quaest.; 19:17 De Trin.; 22:14 Quaest.
In 2:24 De Gen. ad lit. adds et at the beginning of the verse. So also
10:32 De doct. Christ. In 12:4 De civ. and 18:2 Con. Max. autem is
omitted.

De Gen. imp. lib. 1:14, 15, 17 omits sicin the phrase sic ut. De
Gen. con. Man. adds the transitional particle tunc in 227, 83 3:7‚ 17, 21.
In 18 : 4 Quaest. omits nunc.

In 1:29 De Gen. con. Man. adds the relative quod, making a co-
