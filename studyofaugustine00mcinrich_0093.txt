A STUDY OF THE VARIANT READINGS 77

fortunately material for comparison is for the most part lacking. Many
detached verses are quoted in different works, but passages of any consid-
erable length are almost entirely wanting. However several verses from
chaps. 19 and 22 are quoted in both De Trin. and in De civ. Dei with
many variations, though the general character of the text is the same.
Again, in chap. 49 different readings are found in De civ. Dei and Con.
Faust. The evidence seems to show that, while the general character of
the text was the same, i.e., a literal translation of the LXX, different
codices were used at different times. The following point will serve to
illustrate. The Greek word ὤφθη in 12:7; 17:13 22:14 is rendered
apparuit in the text found in De civ. Dei, but in De Trin., visus est.
In 2622 both De civ. Dei and De unit. eccles. read apparuit; in 22:
14 Quaest. agrees with the reading of De civ. Dei, and in 18:1 De Trin.
and Con. Max. both read visus est. In 22:17; 26:2 ff.; 28:10 ff. the
readings of De unit. eccles. point to the use of a different codex. Ziegler
considers this work spurious, basing his conclusion largely upon the differ-
ent character of the biblical quotations;1 but a careful comparison of
the passages quoted from Genesis in De unit. eccles, with the readings
found in other works of Augustine, shows no more significant variations
than those found in many of his writings whose authenticity is not
questioned.

It yet remains to account for the presence of different readings of
the same passage in the same work. The causes that account for the
variations in different works may also operate here. In such books as
De Gen. ad lit. and De civ, Dei, whose composition covered a period
of ten or more years, it would not be strange if different codices were
consulted at different times. Quotation from memory may also account
for many such changes. A passage when first cited may be quoted direct-
ly from some codex, but a few lines farther on a part or the whole of the
same verse may be given from memory. Thus De Gen. ad lit. shows
many variations, and in many instances the passage when quoted the
the second time reverts to the text found in De Gen. con. Man., which
Augustine may be quoting from memory. Cf. also 1 : 6, 7, 263 2: 16.

Another explanation of such differences and of variations in general
may be that Augustine is himself translating the Greek original. Such
an explanation would well account for the differences in synonyms and
the differences in order that have been noted3 for although literally
rendering the same text, a translator would naturally at different times
use different words and forms of expression. That Augustine does occa-
