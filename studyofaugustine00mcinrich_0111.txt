THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 95

eicere, V. proferre,· Gk. ἐκφέρειν; to bring forth3 1:12; in 229, where
the meaning is the same, the Vulg. has producere, Gk. ἐξανατέλλειν,
and in 3:18, Vulg. germinare, Gk. ἀνατέλλειν; cf. p. 62.

enutrire, Gk. ἐκτρέφειν; to nourish; 45:73 rare, not ante-Augustam.

esca, V. necessarium; spolium, ad vescendum=ad escam,· Gk. βρῶσις,
βρῶμα, τροφή; 1:29, 30; 2:9,163 3:6; 42:2; 49:27. Esca seems
to be analogous to the Gk. βρῶσις, meaning both eating and food.
In 42 : 2 ; 49:27, it clearly means food. In the other passages either
meaning is possible. 2:16 is interesting. In Loc. 127 Augustine
says: Non paradiso escae edes, distinguendum est, sed “escae edes’';
nam “esca edes'' dici admittit latina locutio, quoniam pro dativo
casu graeco ablativum vel quem appellant septimum in huius modi
locutionibus solent ponere. The translator seems to have used the
Dat. case here, understanding it to mean, “thou shalt eat sor sood'’;
or perhaps has rendered a Gk. Dat. of Means by a Lat. Dat. and
then we have the common Hebrew construction, which also occurs
in 3:4, “morte moriemini,'' i.e., esca edes=thou shalt eat by eating,
meaning, thou shalt surely eat. Augustine evidently understands
the passage in the latter sense.

esse, V. ibid. ; Gk. εἶναι; 42:133 cf. Loc. 1:167: “sumus'' dictum est pro
“ habitamus.''

exaudire, V. respondere; Gk. ἐπακούειν; 30:33, with causative force;
cf. Loc. 1:111, id est exaudiri me faciet.

exire, V. exoriri‚· Gk. ἐξέρχεσθαιεεοεονίνὶ, 1726.

exerceri, V. meditari‚· Gk. ἀδολεσχεῖν; 24:633 cf. Quaest. 1:69, Qui
verbum de hac re graecum nesciunt, exercitationem corporis putant.
Scriptum est autem αδολεσχῆσαι, ἀδολεσχεῖν, vero ad animi exerci-
tationem pertinet et saepe vitio deputatur, more tamen Scripturarum
plerumque in bono ponitur.

expectatio, V. ibid. 3 Gk. προσδοκία; 49:10, the object of expectation,
the abstract for the concrete.

sacieS, V. facies, vultus‚· Gk. πρόσωπον, except in 24:16. Occurs fre-
quently with a variety of meanings; 2:6 means sursace. Vulg.
has superficies. Note also 2:73 3:193 4:6; 17:3, 17; 19:21, etc.
For peculiar uses in Eccles. Lat. see F orcellini sub verbo.

senum, V. herba; Gk. χόρτος; a herb, not fodde1; 2:5; 3:18. Also in
the Vulg.

fetare, Gk. λοχεύειν; to bring forth3 33:13; occurs in Colum. and Aug.
Cf. Ro'nsch, p. 213.

filius, V. ibid.; Gk. υῖός; 17:12; 29:5. All words of relationship have
