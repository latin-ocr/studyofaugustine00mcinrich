VERBS¹

The tendency to use compound verbs is very marked. Something
over 200 different compounds are used. As might be expected the com-
pounds of con· are the most numerous class. A characteristic of the
colloquial Latin may be observed in the weakening in the meaning of the
compounds, until they sank to the level of the simple verb. This
similarity in meaning is well illustrated by the list of verbs in chap.
iii, p. 63 ff, where the simple verb in one version is synonymous with a
compound verb of another. Other examples might be cited. Cf.
. cognominare 22:143 concludere 16:2; consequi 35: 5; consolari 37:353
enutrire 45:73 inhabitare 21 ε 2 3; renuntiare 24:49, etc.

Other compounds that are rare, or of late origin, are the following:
