THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 107

nidi essent. Cf. also 25:20, Accepit Rebeccam filiam Batuet Syri de
Mesopotamia, sororem Laban Syri, sibi in uxorem; cf. Loc. 1:93: Cum
posset dici tantummodo “uxore7n‚'' aut “uxorem sibi.'⁷ Cf. 43:18.

With facere and dare and esse, etc„ in with the Ace. is used in a con-
struction that comes from the Hebrew through the LXX. Cf. 12:21
Faciam te in magnam gentem. Other cases with facere are 2:7; 21:13,
18; 32:103 With esse, 17:16; 24:60; 28:33 48:193 with dare 17:2031
and with ponere 1716. Another Hebraism is the use of in faciem in
11:43 18:163 1921, etc.

Other uses to be noted are in finem, 46 : 4, meaning finally; in lapidem
=pro lapidem, 11 : 33 cf. notes to this verse3 perambula terram in longi-
tudinem eius, etc., 13:173 another version has in with the Abl. In 17:
7, 9, 10, 12, etc„ the Abl. in the phrases in generationes and in progenies
would seem more idiomatic than the Ace.

B. WITH THE ABLATIVE

In with the Abl. occurs 183 times; 144 times for the Gk. ἐν; 15 for
εῖς; 10 for ἐπί ; once for μετά; 12 times where the Gk. has case construc-
tions or an adverb, e.g. ot>=in quo, 13:143 ἐκεῖεὶη die illa, 15:183 and 6
times the phrase in conspectu is the rendjtion of ε’νάντιον.

The following incorrect uses with the Abl. occur: 1:15 as found in
De Gen. imp. lib. has in with the Abl. where the phrase expresses purpose
or end, while in De Gen. con. Man. and De Gen. adlit. the Acc. occurs. In
1921 notes, the phrase in Sodomis expresses the end of motion 3 cf. in
Sodoma of the other version. Note also 48: 19, Semen eius erit in multi-
tudine gentium; but another version reads in multitudinem,· 40:30,
Dabis calicem Pharaoni in manu eius,· 13: 17, Perambula terram in longi-
tudinem eius et in latitudinem. Another version has here in with the
Abl. These last three cases may be due to the failure of a scribe to
write the correct case form at a period when the final m was no longer
pronounced. No such explanation would account for the other cases.

The phrase in medio, Gk. ἐν μέσῳ, occurs in 1:63 2:93 3²3, 8. It is
followed by the Gen. in every instance except in 229. Cf. 3:15 notes,
where in medio occurs, but the LXX has ἀνὰ μέσον.

In phrase for Case Construction‚ in is frequently used with the Abl.
to express the point of time. Cf. in die sexto, 2:23 also 2:33 6:45 824,
5; 10:25; 14:13 17:213 21:22, etc. Instrumental uses are found in
3:173 4:173 6:5; 27:403 30:27, 303 32:10, 203 34:263 48:63 49:11.
In 2026 vin mundo corde is equivalent to an Abl. of manner ; and in 19: 16

¹ See Thielmann, Archiv,VIII, p. 504, for the use with dare.
