120 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

duced by quia, 12: 18. Quod with a substantive clause is also found in
30:15. Cf. p. 116 ff. for substantive clauses after verbs of saying, etc.

The ne-clauses in 3:223 19:193 24: 5; 27: 12 are literal translations
of the Gk„ and seem best explained by understanding an ellipsis of a
verb of fearing. Cf. 3:22 De Gen. ad lit.: Et nunc ne aliquando exten-
dat manum et sumat de ligno vilae et edat, et vivat in aeternum. 3: 22 and
27:12 may be explained as independent volitive Subj.‚ but the first sug-
gestion seems the more plausible.

B. USES OF THE INFINITIVE

The uses of the Infinitive in Indirect Discourse and to express Pur-
pose have already been discussed. It remains to consider a few other
uses. The use of the Inf. as a substantive is somewhat extended‚ but
most of the cases can be paralleled in Classical Latin. Cf. timere with
the Ins„ 19:303 20:23 sciens venari, 2 5:27; quid habeo dare, 27:37
notes 3 the appositional Inf. phrase, esse illi Deus, eto, 17: 193 the Inf.
with facere, instead of a consecutive clause, 46:43¹ and the use in 326
De Gen. ad lit.‚ quia placet oculis videre et decorum est cognoscere.

The use of the Inf. with apponere and adicere, a Hebrew construction,
· has already been commented upon. Cf. p. 92.

C. USES OF THE PARTICIPLES

The free use of the Present Participle in imitation of the Gk. is very
striking. The substantive use of the Present Participle has been dis-
cussed, cf. p. 67. The most common use of the Pres. Participle is in
connection with a finite verb, a Hebrew construction? Cf. benedixit
dicens, 1:283 praecepit dicens, 2:16, etc. Some striking etymological
combinations occur: multiplicans multiplicabo, 3:16; dixit dicenS, 17:
173 salvans salva, 19: 17 notes; benedicens benedicam, multiplicans
multiplicabo, 22: 173 videntes vidimus, 26:28; venientes veniemus, 37:
103 interrogans interrogavit, 43: 7.

GERU'ND AND GERUNDIVE

The comparatively few occurrences of the gerund and gerundive
forms, much used in Latin of all periods, is a strong evidence of the
closeness with which the early translators followed the original text.
Exclusive of the first three chapters, but three uses of the gerund are
noted: sciendo scies, 15:133 implendo implebo, 22:17 notes; hora con-
gregandi pecora, 29:73 the first two of which are excellent examples of
