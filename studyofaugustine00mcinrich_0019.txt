groundwork. While the various authorities seem to move in different
lines through several verses, they return to an agreement sufficiently
striking to demand the assumption of a common source.’'

Equally important names can be adduced in support of the theory of
a multiplicity of versions.¹ The adherents of this view base their
conclusions upon two separate lines of argument: first, the statements of
the church Fathers; and second, the variations found in the citations.
Ziegler has made a formidable collection of the testimonia of the Fathers,
which it is not the purpose of this general treatment to consider, though
a few of the most significant passages may well be quoted.² Augustine
in De doctrina Christ„ II, 11, says: “Qui scripturas ex Hebraea lingua in
Graecam verterunt numerari possunt, Latini autern interpretes nullo
modo: ut enim cuique primis fidei temporibus in manus venit codex
Graecus, et aliquantulum facultatis sibi utriusque linguae habere vide-
batur, ausus est interpretari ”3 ibid„ 13: “Quoniam et quae sit ipsa sen-
tentia quam plures interpretes pro sua quisque facultate atque iudicio
conantur eloqui, non apparet, nisi in ea lingua inspiciatur, quam inter-
pretantur.'' In II, 1 1, he speaks of an “infinita varietas Latinorum inter-
pretum.'' It would seem that Augustine believed in a multiplicity of
Old Latin versions. In Jerome the facts seem to be presented differently
and the supporters of both views find in his writings what they consider
evidence for their theories.³ Wiseman attempted to show that “inter-
pretari'’ and its cognates are used by Augustine of recensions as well as
of translations‚⁴ but the supporters of the one-version theory no longer
credit his arguments.⁵ In connection with the bearing of the testimonia
of the F athers upon the solution of the problem Zahn's conclusion con-
tains much force. He says: “It is a thoroughly short-sighted attempt to
seek in the occasional utterances of a Jerome or an Augustine regard-
ing the Latin Bible an answer to the questions that bear on the date of
its origin, the original unity or multiplicity of translators. These
men would not have kept from us a definite tradition regarding the
place, the time, the originator of the version or versions, if they had
possessed such a tradition. What they say has neither in form nor in
