122 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

in 39:6. Cf. Locut. 1:141: Graecis usitata est vulgo locutio, apud nos
recta non est, sed “nesciebat aliquid'' dicimus.

The use of factum est as an introductory tag, without any effect upon
the thought or the syntax of the sentence, is a Hebraism‚ that comes
into the Latin through the LXX. In every instance except 2129 the
Latin is a literal rendering of the Gk. and, as this construction is entirely
foreign to Latin idiom, it would seem that the presence of it in this one
passage would be best accounted for by the supposition of an underly·
ing Gk. text different from the one that has come down to us. A further
characteristic of the Hebrew construction is the use of et introducing the
independent clause. Cf. 6:11 Et factum est, mox ut eduxerunt illum
foras, et dixerunt. This construction occurs in 4:8; 6:1; 11 : 2; 12:14;
19:173 2129, 22; 22:13 27:34; 38zr. In 12:12 and 4:14 the verb
form erit has the same use as an introductory tag.

VI. PERIPHRASIS

The following cases of periphrasis occur: With coepi and the Inf.,
6:13 10:8; 21:16. Habere with the Perf. Participle, 16:53 43:23.
Esse and the Pres. Participle 4:123 4:143 4:173 18:223 37:2.

VII. STYLE

The detailed analysis of the Latinity has shown the close adherence
of the Latin translation to the Gk. original, and a study of the style of
the composition would yield no other results than would be obtained
from a similar study of the Gk. or Hebrew text. Since the purpose
of this investigation is not to analyze the peculiar style of composition
found in the Hebrew Scriptures, but rather to determine those elements
that were introduced by the translat-ors, and the bearing of such evi-
dence upon the questions at issue in reference to the language and style
of the Latin Bible, the study of the style will be confined to a few char-
acteristics generally assumed to be Africanisms.1

The various forms of pleonastic expression, such as the Identical Gen.
and the use of synonymous adjectives‚ are Hebraisms and come into the
Latin through the literal rendering of the LXX. The same is true in refer-
ence to the use of synonymous words and phrases; at least the departures
from the Gk. text are so* few that it seems proper to attribute them to a
difference in underlying text rather than to regard them as an innovation
on the part of the translator. In fact, some such phrases, which are not
found in our version of the LXX, have manuscript authority.
