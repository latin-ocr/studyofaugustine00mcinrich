70 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

in Augustine with all of the readings in the excellent critical apparatus
of Brooke and McClean’s edition of Genesis. The variants there cited
may not all go back as far as Augustine‚ and many are undoubtedly of
much later date, but it is impossible to determine, and they afford some
basis for conjecture. All variants occurring in Augustine that have any
authority in the critical apparatus of Brooke and McClean have been
listed here. Sometimes the authority is limited to one unimportant
manuscript, or to a reading found in the writings of the Greek Fathers‚
while again it may have the weight of considerable manuscript evidence.
The examples for which the manuscript authority is slight will be starred.

Many other differences in the various renditions found in Augustine
may be due to a different underlying text, but as before stated we are able
only to conjecture. It is impossible to determine whether many differ-
ences should be attributed to this cause, to freedom in translation, or to
lack of exactness in quoting. This is especially true in the case of addi-
tions and omissions, and where words of an entirely different meaning
