A STUDY OF THE VARIANT READINGS 79

It has seemed advisable to include in this connection a few general
statements in reference to points that will later be developed to form
separate chapters of the complete study. It has been shown that the
evidence of the versions of Genesis in Augustine points rather to several
recensions of an original text than to independent translations. In
order to determine whether only one original Latin translation of Genesis
was made before the Vulgate of Jerome, it would be necessary to collect
and compare all extant fragments. This has been impossible in connec-
tion with the present study. However, all passages from Genesis quoted
by Tertullian and Cyprian were collected, and those verses which both
of these authors cite in common with Augustine will be given.

Gen. 1:26 Tertul. De Hab. Virg. 15: Faciamus hominem ad imaginem
et similitudinem nostram. Cyprian Adv. Marc. quotes the same. Gen.
3 : 6 Tertul. De Cult. F em. 1 : 6: In doloribus et anxietatibus paris, mulier,
et ad virum tuum conversio tua, et ille dominatur tui.

Cyprian Test. 3:32: In tristitia paries filiOS, et conversio tua ad virum
tuum; et ipse tui dominatur.

Gen. 3: 19 Tertul. Adv. Marc. 5: 93 Terra es et in terram ibis.

Cyprian Test. 3: 58: Quoniam terra es et in terram ibis.

Gen. 19:24 Tertul. Adv. Prax. 13: Et pluit Dominus super Sodomam
et Gomorram sulphur et ignem de caelo a Domino. Cyprian. Test. 3:33
quotes the same.

Gen. 25:23 Tertul. Adv. Iud. 1: Duae gentes in utero tuo sunt, et
duo populi de ventre tuo dividentur, et populus populum superabit et maior
serviet minori.

Cyprian Test. 1:19: Duae gentes in utero tuo sunt, etc., as above.

Gen. 27:28 Tertul. Adv. Marc. 3:24: Det tibi Deus de rore caeli et
de opimitate terrae.

Cyprian Test. 1:21: Et det tibi Deus a rore caeli et a fertilitate terrae.

Gen. 49: 11 Tertul. Adv. Marc. 4:40: Lavabit in vino stolam suam et
in sanguine uvae amictum suum. Cyprian Test. 1 : 21 quotes the same.

A comparison of these passages and of all the other passages of Gene-
sis found in either Tertullian or Cyprian, with the text of Augustine
reveals many agreements in reading, and although many variations are also
found, they are of much the same character as those occurring in Augus-
tine's own citations. Hence the conclusion follows that Tertullian and
Cyprian used codices of Genesis, which had as their source the same
original translation as that from which the text of Augustine was derived.

Robert in his edition of the Pentateuch (pp. cxxviii ff.) compares the
citations of the Fathers as found in Sabatier with the readings of the
