12 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

same verse is quoted, he retains the “ in.'' Gen. 2:19, as found in De Gen.
ad lit„ VI, 5, has the manuscript reading “quid vocaret,⁷' but Zycha
emends to “quid vocabit,’' because the LXX reads τί καλέσει. In
IX: 1 the same emendation is again made, but in IX: 14 “vocaret’' of the
MSS is allowed to stand. In Gen. 17:ss quoted in Quaest. 1:31, “et''
is prefixed, that the quotation may be the same as in De civ. dei, XVI,
26, but “cultam'' is retained although in De civ. dei the reading
“Chanaan'' is found, a difference that would seem of more importance
than the absence of the particle “et.''

Not having access to the manuscripts, I have felt it best to follow
the text as it has been edited, but shall indicate by brackets the addi-
tions apparently made by the editors. Although these emendations
do not affect the results of this investigation, entirely satisfactory work
is impossible until a complete critical edition of Augustine is available.

In reconstructing any given portion of the Old Latin Bible from such
a source as the church Fathers, certain principles must be followed in the
selection of the material. It is at once apparent that the author does not
always quote with the same accuracy. Often a passage from the Bible
is changed to conform to the context in which it is quoted. Again,
the quotation may be from memory and fail of verbal accuracy. Such
conditions are naturally more prevalent where short detached quota-
tions are found than where passages of considerable length are cited.
These shorter citations for the most part occur in the Letters and the
Sermons, and it is in works of this character that one would expect
quotations from memory rather than in the works of controversial
character. Very fortunately a great majority of the quotations from
Genesis occur in works of the latter type, and in passages of such length
as to make it probable that they are made directly from some manuscript
of the Bible, and not from memory. In the composition of the three
special books relating to Genesis, De Gen. con. M an„ De Gen. imp. lib„ and
De Gen. ad lit„ Augustine undoubtedly had a text before him, as he
had also in the Locutiones and Quaestiones. In these works and in
De civ. dei, a majority of the passages from Genesis are found. In his
masterpiece, the De civ. dei, it seems probable that Augustine would
have used some manuscript as the authority for his quotations, a prob-
ability rendered more certain for the Book of Genesis by the fact that
most of the quotations from that book are of such length as to naturally
preclude quotation from memory. Chap. xxvii is the only passage of
considerable length for which the source is the Letters or the Sermons.
Exclusive of the first three Chapters, which are found in the three special
