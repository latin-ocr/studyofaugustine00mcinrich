2 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE’S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

the Old Latin Bible, but as the critical ideals of the eighteenth century
were far different from those of the present time, it is evident that much
cantion must be exercised in using it, if the conclusions reached from a
study of the text as therein found are to be thoroughly sound. In recent
years further reconstructions of the Old Latin Bible have been projected
and P. de Lagarde published m 1885 his Probe einer neuen Ausgabe der
lateinischen U bersetzungen des Alten Testaments, in which were included
Pss. 1- 17. Various other revisions of a part or the whole of Sabatier' s
work have been announced, in which the recently discovered MSS of the
Old Latin Bible would be given a prominent place.1

A much-debated question and one closely connected with the prob-
lem of the reconstruction of the Old Latin Bible is the following: Was
there but a single translation of the Scriptures into Latin, or were there
several distinct translations ? From the time of Sabatier this question
has been much agitated‚ and though it cannot be definitely settled, the
latter view is now most generally accepted.²

Sabatier maintained that the great variety of readings found is not
due so much to the work of independent translators‚ as to the ignorance
and carelessness of scribes, and to the changes and corrections made in the
different manuscripts by the learned readers.³ In opposition to this
theory, his contemporary and rival Bianchini maintains that the evi-
dence of the F athers, as well as the variations in quotations, show that
there were many translations.⁴ Between these two theories the opinions
of scholars have been divided up to the present day without any sub-
stantial advance in the conclusions reached.

The theory of one original translation has been supported by such
men as Wiseman‚ Reusch, F ritzsche‚ Zimmer‚ and Hausleiter.⁵ To
quote Kennedy, the scholars who adhere to this hypothesis hold that
“admitting many minor differences both in readings and renderings
there appears throughout the complexity oi readings one fundamental
