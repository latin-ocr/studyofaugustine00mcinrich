THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 113

*vernaculus, 17:123 *empticius‚ 17:12; *septima‚ 29:273 *primogenita,
2 5: 31; *quintae, 47:26 ; *cognoscibila 229, notes, etc.

Similarly there is a free use of participles as substantives, after the
model of the Greek. Cf. dividens, 1:6 De Gen. ad lit.; dominatus,
comparatu& 17:12 notes; omnium viventium, 3:203 benedicentes and
maledicentes, 12 :3 etc.

Unus, Gk. εἷς, in 21:153 22:13 has not the force of the numeral,

but of the indefinite article.

D. SYNTAX OF THE PRONOUN1

The personal and possessive pronouns are used as in the Classical
period, but much more frequently. They are often superfluous and
entirely unnecessary as far as the clearness of the passage is concerned.
Augustine himself had this feeling as is shown by his remarks in Loc.
1:24, 29, 109.

is²

Is is used more often than any other pronoun, 194 uses being noted,
in 85 of which it is used in the Gen. case, as the possessive of the third
person. In all the other instances it is used as a personal pronoun,
and never as 3 demonstrative. It regularly is a translation of the oblique
cases of αὐτός. In 2:20; 39:6 it has a reflexive force. Ipsi autem
Adam non est inventus adiutor similis ei, 2:203 Et nesciebat quae circa
eum erant nihil praeter panem, ete.‚ 39:15.

hic³
Hic is used both as a demonstrative and as a personal pronoun of the

third person. As a demonstrative it occurs over 50 times, regularly as a
translation of the Gk. οὗτος. In 15:14, 16 the form hoc is a transla-

tion of the Gk. ὧδε.
ille

Ille as a demonstrative is always a translation of the Gk. ἐκεῖνος.
Α5 3 personal pronoun it ranks second to is in its frequency, occurring
84 times. That there is no distinction in the meaning of these two pro-
nouns when used substantively is clear from such passages as 17: 16:
Benedicam autem illam et dabo tibi ex ea filium, et benedicam illum, et
erit in nationes, et reges gentium ex eo erunt. Cf. 17:19, 20. The Gk.
has the pronoun αὑτός in every case, but the Latin translator seeks variety.
