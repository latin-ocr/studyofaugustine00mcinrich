78 A STUDY or AUGUSTINE'S VERsroNs or GENEsrs

sionally make use of the Greek text is clear from his own statements,¹
and from the fact that the reading of the LXX is frequently given and
commented upon. But to what extent he thus made use of the Greek
it is impossible to determine, and his knowledge of Greek has long been
a debated question.² Therefore it seems unsafe to conjecture as to what
part Augustine's own translations from the LXX may have in explain-
ing the variations in his quotations from the Scriptures.

That the readings of Genesis found in Augustine were taken from
different codices has been shown. It now remains to determine whether
these variations have as their source different independent translations,
or whether they are merely recensions of one original translation. In
determining this point it is essential to consider not only the variations
but also the similarities in reading. Many verses of chaps. 1-3, in De Gen.
con. Man. agree verbatim with De Gen. ad lit„ and throughout all of
the quotations one observes exact correspondence in words and phrases,
although the citations as a whole may materially differ. Those who
maintain that in such instances we are dealing with more than one
original translation must explain the similarities; while those who
support the one-version theory must account for the variations. Which
is the easier? It seems highly improbable that different persons, though
literally translating the same Greek text, would so closely approximate
each other in their renderings. The more plausible conclusion is that
various codices had as their source the same original translation, and that
the differences in reading are due partly to the mistakes of copyists,
but largely to the corrections and the changes of scholars who worked
over and revised the original translation. Jerome's translation of the
New Testament was but a revision of the Old Latin versions, and it
seems highly probable that a revision or revisions of a part or the whole
of the Old Testament should be made prior to the Vulgate translation.
If one is justified in speaking of the Authorized Version of King James
and the Revised Version of the English Bible, in which many of the
readings of the former translation are retained, as independent trans-
lations, then the same may be claimed for the Old Latin translations
of Genesis as found in Augustine. If not, then the other theory is to
be preferred, viz.‚ that the different readings are recensions of one and the
same original translation.

Nos autem non interpretati sumus, sed codicum latinorum nonnullas mendositates ex
graecis exemplaribus emendavimus.
