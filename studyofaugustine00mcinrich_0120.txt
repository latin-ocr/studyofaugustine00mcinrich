104 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE’S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

32. In 49:11 we find both the Dat. and the act-phrase, alligans ad vitem
et cilicio.

Other peculiar uses are found in 3:16, ad virum tuum conversio tua.
Cf. 4: 7. In 31 : 2, et ecce non erat ad eum sicut hesterna, etc.y note also the
Hebraisms ad faciem=ad‚ 33:18; facie adfaciem, 32: 30, meaning face
to face. In 17: 21 the phrase ad annum sequentem is an equivalent to an
Abl. of Time: the LXX has ἐν.

There remain to be considered two uses of ad apparently with the
Gen. In 7:23 the text reads, et deleta est omnis suscitatio, ab homine
usqne ad pecudem et repentium et volatilium. The Genitives may be
explained as appositional‚ but such explanation is hardly consistent
with the logical meaning of the passage. The LXX reads ἕως κτήνους
καὶ ἑρπετῶν, etc. The translator evidently with inadequate understand-
ing of the Gk., either considered the word κτήνους as an Ace. form, and
so rendered it by the Lat. Acc., and then translated the two nouns
following by the Gen.‚ retaining the case of the Gk.; or rightly under—
standing the first phrase, rendered it by usque ad pecudem, but carelessly
overlooked the fact that the Genitives following were in the same con-
struction, and mistranslated them. In 43: 34 we read, magnificata facta
est autem pars Beniamin prae partibus omnium quinquipliciter cut illorum.
The explanation of ad illorum probably lies in an ellipsis of partes. The
LXX here reads πρὸς τὰς ἐκείνων, which the translator has rendered
literally, ad meaning “in comparison with.'’

onte
Ante occurs 11 times; 8 times where the Gk. has ε’νάντιον; 3 times
where the Gk. is ε’μπρόσθεν; and once where the Lat. reads apposuit
ante illos, the Gk. has the Dat. Its use for the Gk. ε’νάντιον, in the sight
of, is derived from the Hebrew and Hellenistic Gk., and is peculiar to
Eccles. Latin. Cf. 13:93 18:3; 18:223 19:13, etc.

a ud
Apud occurs but once, in 29:25, in the phrase apud me, where the

LXX has παρά. .
eirca

Circa is used 3 times, all with the Acc.; in 15:12 with reference to
time, Gk. περί; in 35: 5 Gk. κύκλῳ, and 39:6‚ Gk. κατά, with reference
to space. In 39:6 circa might be interpreted as meaning in regard to.

contra

Contra occurs 7 times, four times with its regular meaning, opposite
to, Gk. κατέναντι, ἀπέναντι, 2:143 3:243 21:16 twice. In 1029 it is the
