A STUDY OF THE VARIANT READINGS 75

It is our task to determine whether even under such limitations
the unity of Augustine's Bible can be maintained. Does Augustine con-
sistently use the same text or not? The readings of Gen„ chaps. 1—3, as
found in De Gen. con. Man. and De Gen. adlit. furnish the best material
for εωόγ. The purpose of quotation in these two works is not materially
different, and the citations are of such length as to make it reasonably
certain that the writer is quoting from some manuscript and not from
memory. A comparison with the Vulgate does not reveal any influence
from that source. Are the quotations from the same text? If not what
is the character of the difference ? Zycha while maintaining that Augus-
tine from a certain date was accustomed to cite the Scriptures of the Old
Testament from the same codices, points out that in these works and
in De Gen. imp. lib. there is a great variation in reading.¹ A most cas-
ual glance at the passages in question will suffice to make this evident.
The differences have been classified in the first part of this chapter, and
at this point the general character of the two versions will be considered
rather than the specific variations. That many verses of the two versions
are identical is not denied‚ but the differences are far more striking than
the resemblances. A comparison with the Greek affords one point of
approach. It is at once apparent that the readings of De Gen. ad lit.
are much closer to the Greek original, and in most instances are a word-
for-word translation of the same, while the translation found in De Gen.
con. Man. is much more free. Only in 1:18, 203 2:4, 25 does the latter
more closely approximate the Greek than the former. The general char-
acter of the language and style of both is the same, but the translation of
De Gen. con. Man. is on the whole a little more idiomatic, if such a char-
acterization can be applied to the Latin of the early translations of the
Bible. A few such instances may well be noted. In De Gen. con. Man.
is found a more correct use of tenses in subordinate clauses. Cf. erat
1:93 fecerat 2:153 erant, fecerat 3:1. In 126 the noun divisio is used
instead of the substantive use of the participle dividens‚· 1: 20 sub firma-
mento instead of secundum firmamentum for “under the sky'’; 2:7
finxit Deus hominem de limo for finxit Deus hominem pulverem de terrm
1:22 aquas maris for aquas in mari,· 2:21 implevit locum eius carne for
adimplevit carnem in locum eius‚· 3t1 quare for quid quia,⁸ 321, 3 ne with
the Subj. instead of non with the Fut. Ind. in a prohibition; 3: 5 bonum
est oculis ad videndum et cognoscendum for placet oculis videre et decorum
est cognoscere; 3:12 mulier quam dedisti mihi for quam dedisti mecum;
3:22 an entirely different interpretation of the text, the ne-clause in De
