108 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

in eo quod expresses cause. The usages just cited are in almost every
instance literal renderings of the LXX. A few exceptions are in dicbus,
18:11, where the Gk. has the Gen. case3 and 30:273 35:143 42:34.

In is sometimes equivalent to inter. Cf. Loc. 1:127: In hoc
similes erimus vobis et habitabimus in vobis, id est inter vos. Cf. 34:15;
23:6; 24: 3.

inter

Inter is found 28 times, in all but one as a translation of ἀνὰ μέσον.
In 24:37 inter means among, where the LXX has ἐν. In 9:12; 10:12;
13 :7 ἀνὰ μέσον is rendered inter medium, which phrase is followed by the
Gen. except in 9: 12, where we find inter medium meum et vestrum. Cf.
Enarr. in Ps. 67:19: Quod habent latini codices “inter me et vos'’ vel
“inter me et omnem animam vivam,'' et si qua ibi talia dicuntur “inter
medium meum et vestrum‚'' invenitur in graec0‚ quod est ἀνὰ μέσον. Simi-
larly in 1 :14 notes, ἀνὰ μέσον is rendered inter medium.

iuxta

quta is found 3 times. In 19:13 22:17 for the Gk. παρά; in 46:28
for κατά. In every case the meaning is near.

per
Per is found but six times, in four of which it is used in oaths or asseve-
rations. Cf. 22:163 31:543 Gk. κατά; 24:3 notes, where the Gk. has
no preposition; and in 42:16 Gk. νή. In 15:17 per means among, Gk.
ἀνὰ μέσον; and in 28:12, peris used to express Means, Gk. ἐπί.

post1

Post shows no marked departure from classical usage. In 15 cases
it means after, Gk. μετά, and in two it means behind, Gk. ὀπίσω.
Bonnet cites frequent uses of post in Gregory after verbs of pursuit.
One such example is found in 35: 5: et non consecuti post filios. The
adverb postea rarely occurs, but is replaced by such expressions as post
illud, 6:4; post haec, 15:143 postca occurs in 18: 5.

prae
Prae occurs twice: in 32:12, Gk. ἀπότ-οη account of3 43:34, Gk.
πρός, meaning in comparison with.
praeter

Praeter uniformly means except, besides; cf. 26:13 39:6; 47:223
17: 12 notes. LXX has χώρις, πλήν.
