THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 109

pro
Pro regularly means in return for, because of, Gk. ἀντί, except in
29:20 where the LXX has περί. It is found 7 times, 4:25; 22:13;
26: 5; *29:20, 273 30:163 47:16. Cf. also 11 :3 notes, where the meaning
is instead of, and 22:16 notes.

propter

Propter with its regular force, on account of, occurs 10 times, Gk.
ἕνεκεν, διά. Ob is nowhere found.

secundum

Secundum is the regular translation of κατά, and as such acquires
new meanings. It regularly means according to. In 1 ε 20 De Gen. ad
lit. secundum=sub. In 2 :8 notes secundum is the equivalent of ad, near
to. Cf. Loc. 1: 5: Plantavit Deus paradisum secundum orientem quod
latini habent ad orientem.

secus

Secus occurs but once, 22:17 notes, where the meaning is along,
near to.
sine
Sine is found in 17: 1, where the Gk. ἄμεμπτος is translated sine querel-
la, and in 25:27 notes, where sine dolo is the rendering of ἄπλαστος.
In 41 :44 sine represents ἀνεύ of the LXX.

sub

Sub, Gk. ὑπό, ὑποκάτω, and in 28:18 Gk. πρός, occurs 8 times with
the Abl. and 3 times with the Acc.‚ with no appreciable distinction of
meaning. Cf. 28:18, supposuit sub caput, and 47:29, subice sub femore.
It expresses placein 1:7, 9; 18:4; 19:85 21:15; 24:2‚ 93 28:18; 47:
293 and condition in 41:35.

super

Super is found 63 times, being used only with the Acc.‚ and usually
with the meaning above, Gk. ἐπάνω, or upon, Gk. ἐπί ; but in 28:12 it
represents the Gk. ἐν. The phrase superterram occurs 32 times, and its
equivalent, super faciem terrae, a Hebraism‚ occurs three times, 7:23;
11:23, 9.

Super=de‚ 6: 5; 19:21, a use that is common in early Latin and also
in Late Latin with the Abl.‚ but not with the Acc. In 24: 13, 435 41 : 1,
super is the equivalent of ad, meaning near; and in 4:83 34: 30 it has
the meaning against. ΠΙ 27:133 37:27, super is in a transitional state
