THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 117

where the Gk. has an ellipsis of the verb; 16: 5 where the Gk. has a ὅτι-
clause. 41¹1 where the Gk. also has the 1nf.; but elsewhere the Gk.
{in-clause is taken over into the Latin. The mood is the Ind. in every
instance except 3: 11 notes and 22:12 notes where in the quod-clauses
after nuntiare and cognoscere respectively, the Subj. is used. Also in
5012 dicere ut takes the Subj. In this passage the LXX has the Inf.
In 22: 14 the quod has no corresponding ὅτι in the Gk.
The verbs and the conjunctions with which the construction is used
are as follows:
Videre quia, 124, 8, 10, 12, 18, 21, 253 3:6; 622, 5; 12:14; 42:11
videre quod, 32:25
scirequia, 1518, 133 18:19; 20:63 22:123 scire quoniam, 3:5
dicere quod, 22:14; 42:14; dicere ut, 5022
nuntiare quia, 3: 11
adnuntiare quia, 12:18
audire quod, 42: 2
ignorare quia, 42:23
nescire quia, 44: 15
agnoscere quia, 3 ; 7
intellegere quia, 27: 12
indicare quia, 29: 12
Thus quia is seen to be the conjunction most frequently employed
in this construction. The variant readings sometimes have a different
conjunction from that found in the text. Cf. p. 65 under quia, quod, etc.
In 12:123 18:283 28:16; 37:353 48:1‚ the conjunctions quia and
quoniam are used to introduce a direct quotation and are equivalent
to quotation marks. Cf. Locut. 1:38.

b. INDLRECT QUEsrroNs

The Indicative is the regular mood in Ind. questions. Cf. 2:195
8:75 18:21; 39:63 41:253 42:16. The Subj. occurs in 2:19 De Gen. con.

Man„ and also in the MSS of De. Gen. ad lit„ but has been emended
by Zycha‚ except in Book IX, 14. See pp. 10 ff.

c. CAUSAL CLAUSES

The conjunctions introducing Causal clauses are quia (generally 3
translation of the Gk ὅτι) 22 times ; quoniam 7 times; qnod 2 times;
but in eo quod, 19:163 pro eo quod, 22:16 notes, where the LXX has
ἕνεκεν οῧ; and 26:5‚ Gk. ἀνθ’ ὧν; eo quod 29:20, a clause not found in
the LXX3 propter quod, Gk. διὰ τό, 6:33 18:5; 22:163 Gk. ἕνεκεν οἷ);
and propterea quia, 19:8‚ Gk. ἕνεκεν οὗ.

The Lat. translation closely follows the LXX in these clauses and
