102 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

synonymous, and almost uniformly renders the one by the other, giving
to the Latin preposition a shade of meaning entirely foreign to correct
usage.

In the use of prepositional phrases for case constructions there is not
much departure from the text of the LXX, but the Latin shows some
extension, probably due to colloquial influence. These changes will
be discussed at greater length in connection with the treatment of the
individual prepositions.

A majority of the uses that are to be noted can be paralleled in
classical Latin, and it is not the peculiarity of the usage, but its multi-
plication, that is worthy of attention.

a, ab, abs

“A '² shows few departures from the Classical norm, although it
has made some inroads upon ex. In 53 of the 60 phrases in which it
occurs, a is a translation of the Gk. ‹in-63 three times of παρά where the
Greek preposition used with the name of a person means “from the side
of'⁷; cf. 19:243 23:63 33:193 twice of ε’κ; cf. 6:163 8:21 (but in 6:16
the phrase a latere is rendered ex transverso in another version); of ὑπέρ
in 49: 12 and of ἐπί in 4: 11, and here some MSS read ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς instead
of ἐπὶ τῆς γῇς.

In 728 a Part. Gen. or ex with the Abl. would be more regular after
duo.

A peculiar idiom with a occurs frequently, as in 3:2³, a fructu ligni,
where the classical expression would probably be fructum ligni, or ali-
quid fructus. Similar constructions occur in 2:163 2 : 17 ; 3: 1, 11, 12, etc.

A-phrase for an appositive: Deleam hominem quem feci, ab homine
usque ad pecus, etc., 6:7‚ where one might expect et homines et pecus.
Cf. 7:23. .

“A” with Abl. expressing comparison:1 Maledictus tu ab omni pecore
et omni genere bestiarum, 3: 14, meaning “accursed art thou above every
other animal,⁷' etc.; cf. 49:12, Fulvi oculi eius α vino et dentes candidiores
lacte. This passage admits of two interpretations. The phrase a vino
may be taken as an Abl. of Cause, but as the Greek Prepositionis ὑπέρ,
in excess of, and as the last phrase has the comparative candidiores,
natural rhetorical balance would make it more probable that the preposi-
tion a here has the comparative force. In 32:10 the a phrase again is
uncertain, but a causal interpretation seems preferable, although a
comparative force may be read into the passage.
