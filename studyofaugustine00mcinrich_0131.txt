F. SYNTAX OF THE VERB
1. USEs or THE TENSEs

1. In Independent Clauses: The use of the present tense with the
force of the future, which probably goes back to a period in the develop-
ment of the language when a single verb form served to express a variety
of tense and mood feelings, a construction found in all periods of the
Lat. language, also occurs in our translation of Genesis. Cf. 19:13
where the Gk. also has the Pres.; 23:6 Gk. F ut.; and 4826 notes, Gk.
Subj. The imperfect tense is very freely used, often with no distinc-
tion from the perfect. Cf. 19: 30, ascendit et sedebat; 28: 13, I ncumbebat
et dixit. The imperfect of esse is used very frequently, while the perfect
occurs but three times in the entire translation.

The F uture Perfect tense is also very freely used. Cf. 3: 53 12:13
15:14; 17:14; 18:283 21:63 22:23 26:21; 27:29,40; 32:83 32:11, ete.

2. In Dependent Clauses: There are many violations of logical
grouping of tenses, particularly is this true in dependent clauses in the
Ind. The Gk. Aorist is often translated by the Lat. Perfect, where
the meaning demands the Pluperfect. Cf. p. 68. Additional examples
are found in 6:6; 8:7; 34:1; 42:93 46:26.

In quia· and quod-clauses, in Indirect Discourse, there is almost uni-
versal failure to shift the tense. This is clearly due to the influence of
the Gk., but the translator also works independently of the Gk. text
as is shown by his practice where the Gk. has an ellipsis of the copula,
which is in his translation often supplied without regard to the logical
tense feeling. Cf. 1:4‚ Vidit Deus lucem quia bona est. Note also
138, 10,12, 18, 21, 253 3:1, 6,10, 11, 203 6:2‚ 5, 63 8:73 18:193 26:1,
283 29:123 32:25; 41:253 42:1,etc.

2. USEs or THE MooDs
a. INDICATIVE

The Future* Ind. has a widely developed usage, possessing force
equivalent to the Imperative, and to the Independent Volitive Subj.
This use of the Fut. found in Plautus, Terence, and the poets reached its
