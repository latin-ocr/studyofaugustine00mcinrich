IN TRODUCTORY 5

horne of the Latin Bible. It is found that the Old Latin MSS of the
N ew Testament are almost constantly grouped with other Greek-Latin
MSS and the Syriae versions. That is to say, the Old Latin MSS form
an important branch of the so-called “Western” text of the New Testa-
ment. Hort says, “On the whole we are disposed to suspect that the
‘western’ text took its rise in N.W. Syria or Asia Minor, and that it
was soon carried to Rome and thence spread to Africa and Western
Europe.’'1 Another point urged in favor of the Syriae origin is the
extraordinary agreement. in rare and isolated readings of the early
Syriae versions with the Old Latin.²

Sanday‚³ in endeavoring to explain the relation of the Old Latin MSS
· to one another and to the Syriae versions, believes that the starting-
point must have been not a single MS, bilingual or other, but a workshop
of MSS3 that at the very threshold of the Latin versions there must
have been several MSS copied in near proxirnity to each other, affected by
allied, but yet different, Greek texts. He then asks in what class the
version was likely to arise, and finds the answer in the “notarii,⁷' public
copyists‚ who had to do with not only the copying but the translating.
“And where would this class of copyists congregate most thickly but
in the suite of the governor of one of the most important provinces ?''
Further, it is pointed out that the author of the Western text had a knowl-
edge of Hebrew and Aramaic‚ and finally the numerous interpolations
which the text derived either from oral tradition or from some early frag-
mentary source could have had no more probable birthplace than Syria.

The whole problem of the Old Latin Bible is further complicated
by that mooted passage in De doctrina Christ„ II, 15: “In ipsis autem
interpretationibus Itala ceteris praeferatur, nam est tenacior verborum
cum perspicuitate sententiae.'' Is Augustine speaking of and reeom-
mendjng an independent translation? If so, the theory of unity must
fall. If not an original translation, is it merely a reeension as the sup-
porters of the one-version theory maintain? Secondly, what is the sig-
nificance of the adjective “Itala'' ? Does it point to Italy as the home
of the translation, or is it merely applied to a type of text current?

Bentley was skeptical as to the reading of the text, and character-
istieally proposed an emendation of “Itala nam'’ to “illa quae.''4 Cors-
