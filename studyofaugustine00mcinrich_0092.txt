76 A STUDY OF AUGUsrmE’s VERsrons oF GENEsrs

Gen. con. Man. being a clause of purpose, while in De Gen. ad lit. it
must be construed as an independent use of the Subj.‚ or with ellipsis
of a verb of fearing; 3:23 the ut-clause of purpose for an infinitive of
purpose, etc.1 In 2:19—213 2:233 3:1; 3:8; 3:22-24 the differences
are particularly striking.

If the quotations from the first chapter of Genesis as found in De
Gen. imp. lib. are compared with the readings given in the works just
cited, still further variations will be observed‚ though the translation as
a whole approximates most closely that found in De Gen. con. Man.

The quotations from Gen. 4: 11, 123 and 17:10—14 as found in Con.
Adim. seem to be of the same general type as those in De Gen. con. Man. ;
while the same passages as quoted in Con. Faust. and De civ. Dei are
close to the Greek original. What explanation of this state of affairs
can be offered? The date of the composition of the different works
may afford some clue. De Gen. con. Man. was written in 389. De Gen.
imp. lib. about 393, Con. Adim. 394, Con. Faust. about 400, De Gen. ad
lit. 401—15. The freer type of translation is thus seen to be found in the
earlier writings. Unfortunately no other quotations from Genesis of
any great length are found in the early writings, to throw further light
upon this point, but almost without exception the readings in the later
works, while often differing from each other, are of the same general
character, closely conforming to the Greek. That Augustine himself
recognized these two types of translation is evident from De doct.
Christ. 2:13, H abendae interpretationes eorum qui se verbis nimis obstrinx-
erunt ..... aliorum, qui non magis verba quam sententias interpretando
sequi maluerunt. Thus we are led to conclude that Augustine in his
earlier works used a freer type of translation than in the later writings.
A comparison with the LXX of the quotations from Genesis found in
the works written subsequent to 400 shows a remarkable agreement, the
“tenacitas verborum’' of the Itala. Particularly is this true of the text
quoted in De Gen. ad lit. and De civ. Dei.²

It has been shown that the type of text used in the earlier works
differs from that found in the later. It remains to consider whether
the same codex was consistently used in the writings of later date. Un-

¹ In the above examples the reading found in De Gen. con. Man. is in each instance
given first.

²In Gen. 11:33 11:10; 17:63 24:33 2822 the readings found in De civ, Dei
correspond exactly with the readings in Loc., which Augustine designates as Greek
in contrast to the Latin. Cf. the phrases “graecus habet''; “graeci codices habent‚''
etc.
