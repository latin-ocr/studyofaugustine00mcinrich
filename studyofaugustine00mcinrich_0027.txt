CHAPTER II

THE TEXT

The reconstruction of any part of the Old Latin Bible from the
citations of the F athers is a difficult task, and in the case of Augustine
this difficulty is increased by the lack of a scholarly edition of his entire
works. Dombart’s excellent edition of De civitate dei, and Knoll's
of the Confessiones were used, and the Vienna Corpus scriptorum eccle-
siasticorum latinorum, as far as published, but for a great part of the
work the Migne edition must still form the basis of study.

In the reconstruction of the text the orthography of the editions above
mentioned has been followed in every instance, no changes being made
except in the correction of typographical errors, which are found on
almost every page of the Migne edition. Thus no attempt has been
made to secure uniformity of orthography, nor has the orthography of
the text formed any part of the study. Some volumes of the Vienna
Corpus are not much of an improvement upon the Migne edition except
from the standpoint of typography. Particularly is this true of the
volume edited by Joseph Zycha. In the introduction to Vol. XXVIII,
sec. III, Part III, pp. v ff.‚ Zycha states the erroneous principle which it is
his intention to follow in emendjng the biblical quotations found in the
works of Augustine. Starting with the preconceived notion, correct
enough in itself, that the Old Latin Bible was translated from the LXX,
he proceeds to emend the quotations to conform to the readings of the
Tischendorf-Nestle edition of the LXX, evidently overlooking the
fact that the Greek text, from which the Latin Bible was translated,
probably differed as much from the Tischendorf-Nestle edition as the
biblical quotations found in the manuscripts of Augustine differ from
his own emended readings.1 Nor is he consistent in follownig this
principle of emendation. Space does not admit of noting many of his
inconsistencies, but attention will be called to a few. In De Gen. imp. lib„
chap. viii, Gen. 1:7‚ he inserts a second “inter’' in conformity with the
LXX, but later in the same chapter, and again in chap. ix, where the
same verse is repeated, he allows the reading of the MSS to stand. In
De Gen. ad lit„ IV, 12, Gen. 2:2, although a majority of the MSS read
“in septimo die,⁷' Zycha omits the poeposition, but in IV: 10, where the
