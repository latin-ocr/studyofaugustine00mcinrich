CHAPTER IV

THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE

The phase of the Old Latin Bible that is of particular interest to the
student of philology is the study of its language and style. The current
opinions in reference to the Latinity of the pre-Hieronymian trans-
lations have been stated at some length in the introductory chapter.1
Whether the Old Latin Bible was composed in the speech of the common
people, and should be considered a fertile source for the study of col-
loquial Latin or whether the peculiarities there met are Grecisms and
Hebraisms, emerging through the LXX, or whether both elements enter
into its composition, is the question at issue. It is the purpose in the
ensuing chapter to make a detailed study of the language and style of
the fragments of the Old Latin readings of Genesis, as they are preserved
by Augustine, comparing them in every instance with the text os the
LXX, in order to determine whether such peculiarities have their source
in the underlying Greek or whether some other explanation is to be
sought. The reconstructed text has been studied as a whole, no attempt
being made to differentiate between readings that apparently come
from different codices, the present object being merely to study the
general character of the Latinity of the early translations. For the
purpose of comparison statistics have occasionally been given. In all
such instances they apply only to the main body of text, and not to the
variant readings. For the first three chapters of Genesis the readings
found in De Gen. ad lit. have formed the basis for any statistics, inas-
much as in that work alone are the three chapters quoted entire. All
peculiarities of language and style in the variant readings that are not
also common to the text proper have been noted.

I. WORD-FORMATION

The aim in studying word-formation has been to note the examples
of those formatioris that are peculiar to the colloquial speech. For the
history of each group, reference is made to Cooper's “Word-Formation
in the Roman Sermo Plebeius.''
