CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTORY

The origin and history of the Old Latin Bible has long been a subject
os interest both to students of theology and to students of classical
philology. But in spite of many investigations and lively discussions
the question is still involved in obscurity, and an agreement in reference
to the points at issue is no nearer at hand than in the earliest days of
the controversy. As an introduction to the work herein undertaken,
it has seemed advisable to set forth as briefly as possible the history and
the present status of the problems connected with the study of the Old
Latin Bible. In the preparation of this chapter extensive use has been
made of the excellent reviews of Corssen‚ Kennedy, and Ν estle‚1 besides
various works of more general character to which reference will be made.

In speaking of the pre-Hieronymian version or versions the name
“Old Latin'’ will be used, in accordance with the practice of English
scholars.² Unfortunately comparatively few fragments oi this pre-
Hieronymian translation are preserved in manuscripts, and we are
compelled to supplement this scant material with citations of the Scrip-
tures found in the works of the early Latin F athers‚ a source that involves
one in many difficulties and further complicates the problem.³

The first attempt to reconstruct the Old Latin Bible was made by
Flaminius Nobilius, whose plan was to collect from the Latin Fathers
all citations from the Old Testament, and to supplement them where
they were lacking with a translation of the LXX as found in the Codex
Vaticanus. This reconstruetion, published in 1588, was replaced by the
monumental work oi the Benedictine monk, Pierre Sabatier, whose
Bibliorum sacrorum latinae versiones antiquae seu vetus italica in three
volumes was published at Remis in 1743-49. This work consists partly
of citations from the church Fathers‚ and to a less extent of fragments
of MSS. It still remains the most complete source for the study of
