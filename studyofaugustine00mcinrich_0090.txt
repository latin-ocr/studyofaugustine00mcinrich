74 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

In 3:23 De Gen. con. Man. inserts et with intensive force. In 9:25
Quaest. omits puem· 1127 De civ. omits ibi,· 15: 12 Quaest. omits
tenebrosus,· 17: 17 Loc. omits et risit,· 27:39 Sermo 4 omits desuper, and
in 48: 5 De con. evang. omits in Aegyptum.

The fact that such variations as those classified exist in Augustine's
quotations from the Bible would seem to preclude all thought of its unity.
But frorn the time of Sabatier there have been those who maintain that
Augustine preferably used one and the same translation, presumably
the Itala. But even those who support this theory acknowledge that
under certain conditions different texts were used, yet they neverthe-
less hold that under these limitations their thesis stands. Thus Ehrlich
says: “Wir durfen also wohl die in seinen Schriften enthaltenen Bibel-
stellen in der Hauptsache als der Itala entnommen ansehen‚ und es zeigt
sich in der That in seinen Anfiihrungen mit Ausnahme seiner friiheren
Schriften, eine grosse Ubereinstimmung‚ wobei freilich nicht zu leugnen
ist, dass er zuweilen dieselbe Stelle in den verschiedenen Werken
und selbst innerhalb desselben Werkes in voneinander abweichender
Form anfiihrt. Diese Abweichungen, teils geringe, teils bedeutendere,
sind entweder durch freies Citieren aus dem Gedachtniss entstanden‚
oder indem er den Bibeltext mit seinen eigenen Worten in organischem
Zusammenhang brachte‚ teilweise aber durch Benutzung anderer Uber-
setzungen, besonders‚ wenn ihn etwa seine eigene Handschrift im Stich
lieSS.''1

Ziegler recognizes the fact that in writings of a certain character
Augustine used many different Latin codices, comparing them with
each other and with the Greek, and at times he himself attempts a trans-
lation from the LXX. Particularly is this the case in the Quaestiones
and Locutiones. So he contends that when a passage of the Scriptures
was cited for the purpose of textual criticism Augustine used different
codices of the Old Latin Bible. But when the purpose of the quotation
was to instruct the reader, or to convey some teaching, he holds that
the citations are for the most part from one and the same text. The
variations are explained as due to various causes. First, in the works
written prior to 388 a different text is assumed to have been used3 sec-
ond, Augustine gave free play to his own critical spirit and did not always
adhere closely to the text, but introduced various changes; and third,
it was the constant tendency of the scribes in the Middle Ages to change
the quotations from the Bible to conform to the readings of Jerome's
Vulgate with which they were familiar.²
