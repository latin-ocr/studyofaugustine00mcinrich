THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 103

Other departures from classical usage are found in 27 : 39, a fertilitate
terrae habitatio tua et a rore caeli desuper; and in the phrase a facie,
meaning away from, a Hebraism; cf. 3:8; 4:143 6:73 3521.

ad¹

The extension in the use of ad is more marked, and this preposition
has begun to take on those uses which are further developed in the
Romance languages. Most of the constructions here observed can be
paralleled in classical Latin, but the multiplication of their usage is a
colloquialism. In 54 cases ad is a translation of the Greek πρός; in 8
of εἰς; in 6 of ἐπί ; in 4 of κατά; in 2 of ἐν, and 6 times usque ad is the
equivalent of the Greek ἕως. Α colloquial development is the frequent
use of ad for the Dat. case, especially to express the relation of the Ind.
Obj. In this use the Greek is not the basis of the construction, as in
many instances the Gk. Dat. is rendered by ad with the Acc.

Unusual or rare meanings of ad: Ad, Gk. xani=according to, 1:26,
27 ; 5:1; a Classical usage. Ad=adversus‚ 32:25: non potest ad eum.
Ad is used to express place where, 3 : 8, De Gen. con. Man.; 14: 13, Gk. ε’ν;
18; 1, Gk. πρός with the Dat.=Lat. ad ilicem,· 18: 1, ad ostium, Gk. ἐπί
with Gen.

Act-phrase for Case Construction. The act-phrase in classical Latin
often 15 used instead of the Dat. of Purpose, but in our text it is used
almost to the complete exclusion of the case construction. The in-
phrase is also used with the same force, in fact, in with the Acc. and ad
are almost synonymous. Bayard, op. cit., p. 138, notes in St. Cyprian
a frequent use of ad with substantives, verbal and non-verbal, with the
force of a gerund. The same usage is found here3 cf. ad escam, 219 ;
ad aspectum, 2:93 and 326 where one version has the same expression,
and the other has ad with the gerund. Other examples are numerous.

Ad with verbs of saying: A very common construction which in
some cases goes back to the Gk. original, and in others represents the
Gk. Dat. Examples of the latter are found in 3 : 1, 2, De Gen. con. Man.;
4:6; 12:13 17:15; 18:33; 31:313 47:5‚ 8; 50:6. There are 17 cases
of ad with verbs of saying, where the LXX has a preposition also. The
Dat. is also frequently found as Ind. Obj.

Ad with the Acc. for Ind. Obj. with other than verbs of saying occurs
in 2:243 17:19317:21; 24:49.

Compound verbs that may take a Dat. are almost invariably fol-
lowed by the preposition. Cf. 2:24 notes; 8:9; 8:213 25:173 49:11,
