IN TRODUCTORY 9

views says, “Mag daher auch in der Sprache der altesten Bibeliiber-
setzungen noch so vieles als Gracismen und Hebraismen zu erklaren
sein, mogen die Ubersetzer auch hin und wieder Glossare benutzt haben:
ich. sehe keinen Grund, weshalb sie Entlehnungen aus der lebenden
Volkssprache ganzlich vermieden haben sollten.'⁷1 Cooper in his Intro-
duction says, “Tertullian and the unknown translator of the Itala did
not write in Vulgar Latin, pure and simple, although the latter formed
a large ingredient of their style.’'² And finally Corssen takes the follow-
ing view: “Viel zu stark wird das Volkstiimliche in der Sprache betont,
wahrend sie uberali durch das Griechische bestimmt ist und jenes nach
der Natur der Sache nur eine untergeordnete Rolle spielen konnte.''³
Thus we find a variety of views ranging from the one extreme, namely,
that the language into which the Old Latin Bible was translated was the
sermo vulgaris, to the other, that the peculiarities of style and language
are Grecisms and Hebraisms that have been brought over from the
LXX into the Latin translation.

Such then in summary are a few of the many views held in reference
to the origin, history, and the character of the Old Latin Bible, but the
solution of the problem has not yet been reached. It is evident that
many facts that hold as to the nature of some parts of the· Bible are not
true of the entire text, and the conclusions reached from a study of
some small portion of the Bible must not be generalized, as has some-
times been done, to apply to the Scriptures as a whole. As Nestle‚
quoting F ritzsche, well says, “Um sichere allgemeine Resultate zu
gewinnen, wird man erst die einzelnen Bucher durchforschen miissen.”⁴
In pursuance of that view the following investigation was undertaken.

The original intention of the writer was to make a complete study
of the version or versions of Genesis as cited in the works of St. Augus-
tine‚ perhaps the richest extant source for the study of the Old Latin
Bible. De Lagarde, whose projected Biblia Augustina failed to reach
the press on account of the lack of sympathetic interest, collected 42,216
biblical quotations from the works of the great Bishop of Hippo.

The first task taken up was the reconstruction of the text of Genesis,
no small labor in itself. It was planned to study the reconstructed text
with reference to its bearing upon all of the problems connected with the
Old Latin Bible3 to compare and analyze the various readings in order
