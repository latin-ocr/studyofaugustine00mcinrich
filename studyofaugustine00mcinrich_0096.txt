80 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

Codex Lugdunensis. But very few exact parallels are detected and not
many verses which show numerous points of resemblance. A careful
comparison of this material with Augustine’sxversions of Genesis reveals
many more points of resemblance than those noted by Robert. Many
fragments of verses quoted by Augustine agree verbatim with the read-
ing of the Codex Lugdunensis. Other verses are exact parallels with the
exception of a single word, or a change in order. Some of the passages
that exhibit many points in common are the following: 16:9‚ 16 ; 1721,
5‚6‚ 15, 16; 19:17, 22; 27=3‚8‚9‚18‚19‚24‚27‚29; 28=1‚13‚14‚16‚19;
2915, 203 3112, 31, 543 32³3, 5, 17; 37:10, 27, 313 38³1, 2, 3, 133
42:363 43³7, 8; 4426⁷ 29; 45=3; 46:31,34; 47¹8v155 49:83 50³5, 15·
A great percentage of these passages, and those in which the resemblance
is most striking, are quoted in Locutiones and Quaestiones‚ hence
Robert's conclusion that Augustine used a manuscript of the same family
as the Codex Lugdunensis in the composition of these works seems well
founded. Therefore the evidence seems to show that the Codex Lug-
dunensis possessing so many points in common with Augustine's cita-
tions, is from the same original source as the different manuscripts that
he consulted.

Does Augustine ever quote from Jerome’s translation of Genesis?
When one considers the opposition of Augustine to the Vulgate transla-
tion of the Old Testament and his preference for the LXX, it seems highly
improbable that he would use Jerome’s version in his quotations.1
A comparison of the two texts reveals some few similarities, confined
largely to single words and short phrases, In Gen. 4: 18; 16:9; 21 t 123
29:5; 31:533 32:30; 35:26; 39:12, where Augustine quotes but part
of the verse there is exact correspondence. In 2:18, 22, 24; 319, 213
4:10; 5:43 9:13 1117, 27; 12:23 15:63 19:23 21:10‚17; 25:173 26:243
27:24,36; 30:16; 31:73 42:543 43:343 46:313 47:29 points of resem-
blance can be noted. When the attitude of Augustine toward the
Vulgate is taken into consideration, how are these similarities to be
explained? Two explanations are possible. F irst, that Jerome made
use of the Old Latin Bible in his translation of the Old Testament, pre-

1 Cf. Aug. Epist. 82, chap. 5: . . . . Intelligant, propterea me nolle tuam ex
hebraeo interpretationem in ecclesiis legi, ne contra LXX auctoritatem, tamquam novum
aliquid proferentes, magno scandalo perturbemus plebes Christi. Epist. 71, chap. 2:
Ego sane te mallem graecas potius canonicas nobis interpretari Scripturas, quae LXX
interpretum perhibentur. De civ. Dei 18:43: Ex hac LXX interpretatione etiam in
Latinam linguam interpretatum est quod ecclessiae Latinae tenent. De doct. Christ.
2:16: Et Latinis quibuslibet emendandis Graeci adhibentur, in quibus LXX interpretum,
quod ad Vetus Testamentum attinet, excellit auctoritas.
