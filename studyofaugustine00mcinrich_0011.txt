PREFACE

During the summer of 1906 while pursuing a course in late Latin
prose under Dr. E. A. Bechtel at the University of Chicago, it was
suggested that the biblical citations found in the works of the great
Bishop of Hippo, St. Augustine‚ would furnish a fruitful field for inves-
tigation. To that suggestion this study owes its inception. The
work was carried on under Dr. Bechtel's supervision, and Ι am indebted
to him for kind and helpful suggestions. My thanks are also due to
Professor Frank F rost Abbott‚ who read my manuscript and made

valuable suggestions and criticisms. J S M
