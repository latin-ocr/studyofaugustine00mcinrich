THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 105

equivalent of coram, Gk. ἐνάντιον, and in 15:10 contra faciem, Gk. ἀντι
πρόσωπα, means “opposite,'' a Hebraism.

coram

Coram is found in 11:28; 16z5, with the Abl. In Loc. 1:30 we
find the following comment: Incertum est utrum possit accipi coram Domi-
no Deo, quia sic solet intelligi, quod graece dicitur ἐνάντιον.

cum

’ There are 48 examples of the use of cum, in all but two of which the
LXX has μετά. In one of these two, 4628, the cum-phrase is not found
in the LXX; and in 46:27 cum quibus, etc„ represents a participle in
the Gk.

Cum is used almost exclusively to express Accompaniment. A
few modal uses occur: cum pace, 15: 15; cum dolo, 27: 353 cum tristitia,
4223& 44:29·

The cum-phrase is used for a Dat. in 3:12: Mulier quam dedisti
mecum‚· cf. 23:4, Peregrinus et advena sum ego vobiscum· and 26:29,
Ne facias nobiscum malum; also 28: 15. In 3 5:2 cum is the equivalent
of inter, “Tollite deos alienos qui sunt vobiscum.'' Note the usage in 32:
28 which seems to have no parallel in classical Lat„ Quia valuisti cum
Deo, etcum homiuibus potens es.

de¹

De had already begun to make inroads upon ab and ex, and especially
upon the latter, and more than any other preposition shows the collo-
quial influence. Most of the constructions with de have their prototypes
in the Classical period, and the multiplication of the examples is again
the thing to be noted. De occurs more frequently than ab or ex, being
found 67 times, 42 times as a translation of ε’κ, 15 times of ἀπό, and 4
times of περί. In 2:21 and 3:22 the LXX has the Gen. case without
any preposition, and in 24: 5 the phrase de qua represents the Gk. adverb
ὅθεν. In some cases the phrase is not found in the LXX, as in 32:11.

De for ex: After verbs compounded with ex, de almost invariably
is used. Cf. 219, 103 10:115 11:313 12:1; 15t4, 73 19:12, 29; 24:5;
32:113 46:26.

De-phrase for Genitive case: The use of a de-phrase instead of a Part.
Gen. is very common. In many cases the cle-phrase is not dependent
upon any noun, but is used absolutely, as the cases already noted
under a and ab. Cf. de ligno manducabitis, 2:17; also 3:3; 3:6; 3:17,
