VERBS

There are a few more peculiarities in the inflection of the verb than
in the noun. In 6:7 deleam seems to be Fut. Ind., though the constant
use of the Fut. Ind. and the Pres. Subj. with no appreciable distinction
in meaning makes it impossible to determine. The Vulgate has delebo,
and the LXX ἀπαλείψω. The same question arises in 17:6 where the
text reads augeam te valde valde et ponam te in gentes, et reges ex te exibunt.
Here the Vulgate is of no assistance in determining the form, as it has
the form faciam. The Greek, however, is αὐξανῶ, which would incline
one to believe that augeam is here meant for a future form.

The irregular verb exeo has the Fut. form exiet in 15z4 and exient in
17:6 notes3 but in 15:14 exibunt, in 42: 15 exibitis‚· cf. transibitis
18: 5, etc.

There is a preference shown for the reduplicated Perf. forms of the
compounds of curro, which usage was proscribed by the grammarians.¹
Cf. procucurrit, 18:23 but another version has procurrit; adcucurrit, 1817.

The syncopated Perf. forms are the rule. Such forms developing
in the early period of the language, and originating in colloquial Latin,
are at this period in common use, and are probably no longer to be con-
sidered as a colloquialism.² Cf. audisset 37:21; audissent 34:73 audi-
erunt 318 ; dormisset 34:73 obaudisti 22 : 18; exaudisti 22:18 notes3
exaudistis 42:223 declinastis 18: 53 adnuntiasti 12:183 peccasti 4:73

¹ Cf. Servius as quoted by Lindsay, The Lat. Lang., p. 504: “Verba quaein praerterito

perfecto primam syllabam geminant, cum composita suerint geminare non possunt. Cf.
Bayard, Le Latin de St. Cyprien, p. 59.

² An examination of a considerable amount of the text of the purist Fronto revealed
that he regularly used such forms. Cf. Lindsay‚ op. cit, p. 5083 Bayard, op. cit, p.
60.
