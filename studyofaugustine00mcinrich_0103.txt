THE LATINITY OF THE OLD LATIN BIBLE 87

adaquare; cf. p. 85.

appropriare; cf. p. 85.

adnuntiare· V. indicare‚· Gk. ἀπαγγέλλειν; to tell; 12:18. Occurs
also in Seneca, Pliny, and Curtius, but its use is almost entirely con—
fined to Eccles. Latin.

compalpare; to touch; 27:12. Found also in Aug. Sermo 214. The
verse in which this word occurs is evidently not a direct quotation,
but an adaptation‚ and the word may be one of Augustine’s own
coinage.

Found in Tertul. Adv. Gnost. 133 Alcim. Avit. Ep. 41: Cyprian

VERBA ΒΕΟΟΜΡΟΞΙΤΑΙ

Double compounds belong primarily to late Latin, although some
examples are found in the early period. Cooper has found in Cicero,
outside of the Epist„ only 11 forms, three of which abscondere, compre-
hendere, and derelinquere are found here. Other double compounds are
exsurgere 18: 16 note53 insurgere 428 notes3 both of which were in com-
mon use3 repromittere 49:10 notes, found also in Plaut.‚ Cicero, Suet..
etc„ and disperire 17:14 notes, which is largely ante-classical. In
less common use were the following:
adinplere 2:213 found also in Colum.; common in the Vulg., Old Latin,

and Eccles. Latin. The occurrence of this word in Livy, cited by
Cooper, is not given in the Thesaurus. Ronsch‚ p. 206.
insufflare 2:7‚ notes; frequent in Vulg. and Old Latin3 also in Ambr.
Inst. Virg. 113 Aug. De civ. Dei 18:31. et 31. Ro'nsch, p. 208.
pertransire 15:17. Pliny N.H. 37:5‚ 18. Common in Vulg.

¹ See Cooper, p. 289. Cooper has omitted exsurgere and repromittere from his list of
double compounds that are found in Cicero.
