1. USEs OF PREPOSITIONS wrm SUBSTANTIVES

In the study of the prepositions the three following points are to
be noted: first, the extension in the meaning of certain prepositions;
second, the encroachment of some of the prepositions upon the uses of
the others, ultimately resulting in the disappearance of the latter in
the Romance languages3 and third, the use of prepositional phrases
for case constructions. Two forces operated to produce these changes,
the influence of the colloquial speech, and of the Greek original, the
latter of Which seems to have been the dominant factor in bringing about
the first and third conditions noted above. Many uses of the preposi-
tions that at first thought might seem to be due to the influence of the
colloquial speech are found upon closer observation to be literal render-
ings of the Greek text. Similarly the extension of the meaning of the
prepositions can often be traced to the Greek. A Greek and a Latin
preposition express some relations in common, but the Greek has some
phases of meaning not possessed by the Latin; yet the translator,
evidently ignorant of this fact, seems to consider the two as entirely
