A srUDY or THE VARIANT READINGS 69

2. VERBS

Difference in Mood: In dependent clauses tho different readings
sometimes show a difference in the mood of the verb, one having the
Indicative, the other the Subjunctive. Such instances are the follow-
ing: 2³⁷4, a cum-clause; 2: 5, a clause with antequam; 2 ; 19, an indirect
question; 3:11, indirect djscourse with quia and qu0d; 3: 11, with nisi;
22: 12 indirect djscourse.

The Pres. Subj. in independent sentences is often parallel to the Fut.
Ind. Cf. 3:13; 17: 113 27:29. So also the Imperative and the Fut. Ind.
1729.

Other differences in the syntax of the verb are the following: noli
with the Inf.—Subj. with ne in the other reading3 28: 13. Inf. of Purpose
—Clause os Purpose 2 : 5, 153 3: 23; 22: 10. In 3 : 24 one version has the
Ins. of Purpose, the other ad with the Gerundive, and in 3:6 are found
Ins. of Purpose‚ ad with Gerund, and ad with a Noun. Infinitive-obj eet
clause in Subj. 3:11, 173 Pare—F inite Verb in Dependent Clause.
1st‚ verb in the Independent Clause, 11:73 13:17; 23:33 25:273 49:
27. 2d, verb in Dependent Clause‚ 19: 13 42:1. Infinitive——Finite
verb 4: 11. In 1 : 31 and 2z2 5 are found an impersonal verb in the one
reading and a personal verb in the other.

Some few inflectional differences are noted, eonfined largely to proper
nouns, which are sometimes treated as declinable, and again as inde-
clinable. Adam—Adae 3:213 Abraham—Abrahae 26: 1, 3; Charra,
Abl.—Clzarran 11: 323 Charram Aeo—Charran 28: 10. Cf. also the
forms exient and exibunt in 1726.

III. DIFFERENT UNDERLerG GREEK TEXT

Here we are largely in a field of conjecture. To credjt differences
in the reading of the Latin text to corresponding differences in the
underlying Greek presupposes a difference of versions and precludes the
theory of the unity of Augustine's Bible. It also presupposes variant read-
ings of the LXX, of which fact we have proof in Augustine's own writ-
ings. A few passages will suffice to show this. Quaest. Ι : 2: N on solum
quippe in Hebraeis aliter invenitur verum etiam iri LXX interpretatione
M atlzusalam in codicibus paucioribus sed veracioribus sex annos ante
diluvium reperitur fuisse defunctus. Ibid. 123: Quamvis normani et
latini et graeci codices nou angelos habeant sed filios Dei. Ibid. 1:155:
Quorum omnium in codicibus graecis, qui a diligentioribus conscripti
sunt, etc.
