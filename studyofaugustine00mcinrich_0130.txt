114 A STUDY OF AUGUSTINE'S VERSIONS OF GENESIS

Thielmannpoints out that in the Latin translations of Sapientia and Sirach
ille is the most common personal pronoun of the third person; but as
observed from the statistics given for our translation of Genesis, ille
is second to is. IS, however, never occurs in the Nom. case, and ille
is sometimes thus used. In 22:13 27: 32, etc„ ille is used in the Latin
where the LXX has a pronominal use of the article. In 15:10 ille has
a reflexive force.
iste¹

Iste, frequent in colloquial Latin, is seldom used, and where it does
occur it has the force of hic. In 32:10 we find the phrase ista mea virga,
where the LXX has only the article. In 19: 8 iste is a translation of the
Gk. οὗτός used demonstratively, and in 29:27 a translation of the same
pronoun used personally.² In 3: 20 and 6: 3 iste is used in one version,
where the other has hic.

ipse³

I pse is the pronoun whose sphere of usage is most enlarged. It occurs
frequently with its original intensive force, but just as often is used as
a personal pronoun of the third person. In the latter instance it is a
rendering of the Gk. αὑτός, and it cannot be doubted that the personal
use of the Gk. αὐτός contributed largely to a similar development of
meaning in the Latin intensive ipse, not alone in Lat. translations of Gk.
writings, but also in the entire field of Patristic literature.⁴ Cf. 3:153
11:2; 14:13; 18:21; 19:16; 24:32, 403 3014, etc. In 3421, Exiit
autem Dina filia Liae, quam peperit ipsi Iacob, ipsi seems to have no
other force than the definite article which is here used in the LXX with
the proper noun.

That there was little or no distinction in the meaning of is, ille, iste,
ipse, and hic can be inferred from reference to the list of the synonymous
uses of pronouns, p. 60.

A peculiarity, which is a Hebraism emerging through the LXX, is
the repetition of the demonstrative pronoun or adverb in a relative
clause, as cuius semen eius, 1:123 de quo . . . . de e0, 2:17; in quibus

. . . in eis, 19:293 de qua... . inde, 24:53 cf. also 24:33 24:42;
28:13; 33:19, etc.

expression occurs in 1:12 notes. It is a literal rendering of the Gk„
